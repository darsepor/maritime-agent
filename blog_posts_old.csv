Aquarius stabilisers for Chesapeake newbuilds,"Kongsberg Maritime is continuing its 15-year partnership with Chesapeake Shipbuilding in the USA, through the supply of its Aquarius retractable stabilisers. The stabilisers will be installed on the latest newbuild cruise ships for American Cruise Lines, a leading operator in the American cruise industry.
The Aquarius retractable stabilisers offer high-performance roll damping, compact and lightweight design, and advanced control systems. They are specifically engineered for smaller vessels, and feature a one-piece high-lift fin, low installation costs, and ease of integration with the ship’s alarm and monitoring systems. The stabilisers come with a fin-box and necessary local stiffening, ready for seamless installation at the shipyard.
With over three decades of industry experience, Chesapeake Shipbuilding has established itself as a designer and builder of commercial ships up to 450 feet in length. Specialising in passenger vessels, tugboats, and ferry boats, the shipyard has developed expertise in maritime construction.
The yard is currently constructing the American Patriot, American Pioneer, American Maverick and American Ranger, along with other vessels for American Cruise Lines (ACL). Set to begin cruising in June of 2025, these vessels will accommodate 130 guests in staterooms with private balconies and a deck of suites. Fully stabilised with Kongsberg Maritime’s Aquarius retractable stabilisers, these new ships will enhance the cruising experience along the US Eastern Seaboard.
Paul Crawford, Sales Director, Kongsberg Maritime, added, “Our long-standing relationship with Chesapeake Shipbuilding demonstrates the importance of effective stabilisation systems on board cruise vessels. We are proud to see our Aquarius retractable stabilisers helping to provide American Cruise Lines’ guests with a comfortable, smooth sailing experience in the coastal and river waters of the USA.”",['Chesapeake; American cruise industry; American Cruise Lines; partnership; cruise; Passenger; shipbuilding; Aquarius retractable stabilisers; stabilisers;'],,"

Kongsberg Maritime to be key player in hybrid conversion of MF Hamlet for Öresundlinjen,"Kongsberg Maritime has secured its latest upgrade project to convert the double ended car ferry MF Hamlet to emission-free battery powered operation. The ferry, operated by Öresundlinjen, on the route between Helsingør, Denmark, and Helsingborg, Sweden, will see a major upgrade including installation of large battery packs and new permanent magnet motors for the azimuth thrusters.
The primary goals of the project include achieving zero emissions, enabling full electric operation with batteries, and having mechanical propulsion redundancy. The ferry will utilise high-voltage charging in port, taking only 8-12 minutes, and low-voltage charging via gensets as an alternative.
Kongsberg Maritime will be responsible for rebuilding the existing thrusters to electric operation, installing new Permanent Magnet (PM) motors for each of the four main azimuth thrusters, each rated at 1530 kW. Additionally, Kongsberg Maritime will provide a comprehensive energy, automation, and control package, which includes interface to the main switchboard, retrofitting the K-Chief 600 to the new K-Chief system with an Energy Management System, and implementing Mcon thruster control with control chairs on the two bridges.
Energy storage systems will be supplied by Echandia directly to the owner, while Oresund Drydocks will handle the mechanical conversion. Installation company SH-Group will produce and install deck houses and ensure that cabling is routed the right way and that the new equipment will be installed and wired.
The rapid conversion job is scheduled to start in November 2025 at Oresund Drydocks, but the vessel will be visiting the yard in March during scheduled maintenance docking for preparation work before operating the summer season and then undergoing conversion.
The conversion will enable emission-free operation with powerful battery packs for each of the four thruster motors. The thrusters will be powered by the electric motors, with the existing diesel engines as a backup. The ferry route between Helsingør, and Helsingborg across the northern and narrowest part of the Øresund strait, is one of the world's busiest international car ferry routes. With the MF Hamlet's conversion, the entire route will be fully electric.
Kongsberg Maritime's scope will include the conversion of the top gear on the four US 3001 Controllable Pitch thrusters, rebuilt to have twin input, where the primary input is driven by the new electric permanent magnet motors and the secondary is connected to the existing diesel engines. The ferry will charge its batteries shoreside connecting to the existing charging robots (10.6 MW/10.4 kV).
The ferry will also be prepared to install Kongsberg Maritime’s Auto-Crossing and Auto-Docking technology to automate transit and harbour manoeuvres.
The MF Hamlet will have completely new deckhouses installed on the top deck, with Kongsberg Maritime energy equipment and the Echandia batteries being key features. The two bridges will get new console layouts to improve visibility and new control chairs for the pilot and co-pilot for enhanced ergonomic operation.
Speaking today at the Martime Battery Forum conference WattsUp 2025 in Helsingborg, Martin Kjøraas, Head of Aftermarket Sales Seaborne, Integration and Energy, at Kongsberg Maritime, said, ""We are proud to lead the electrification of the MF Hamlet ferry. This project demonstrates our dedication to sustainable maritime solutions and our expertise in hybrid and electric upgrades.
“The continuous collaboration between Öresundlinjen, the yard, and all sub-suppliers has been exceptional in the project preparation phase, and we look forward to seeing the positive impact this conversion will have on the environment and the efficiency of this busy ferry route.""",['emission-free battery;  azimuth thrusters;  permanent magnet motors'],,"

Kongsberg Maritime secures contract to equip  Bibby Marine's groundbreaking eCSOV,"Kongsberg Maritime’s comprehensive package will be at the core of this advanced vessel’s systems. The company will provide full-electric rim-drive propulsion with azimuth and tunnel thrusters, along with the DC Hybrid Electric system, and Energy Control System. The scope of supply also includes the automation system, full electrical control system, Dynamic Positioning and thruster control.
The new eCSOV will feature the largest ever battery installation on an offshore vessel, with a capacity of 25MWh. Kongsberg Maritime’s equipment will seamlessly integrate with the battery system and optimise the use of energy on board.
UK-based Bibby Marine has commissioned this pioneering service operation vessel from Spain's Armon shipyard. The hybrid vessel will be capable of operating entirely on electricity for a full day, thanks to the 25MWh Blue Whale Battery Energy Storage System from Norway’s Corvus Energy. This lithium iron phosphate system, the largest maritime battery installation to date, will enable the vessel to operate on electricity for 24 hours.
Bibby Marine New Build Project Director, Gavin Forward said: “We are thrilled to embark on this pioneering journey with Kongsberg Maritime as one of our partners. This groundbreaking vessel, equipped with Kongsberg’s fully integrated package, including Rim Drive thruster units, will ensure our optimal efficiency and operational excellence.
“The eCSOV marks a significant milestone not only for Bibby Marine and its partners, but also for the entire maritime industry and will certainly push the boundaries of innovation in the offshore energy sector.”
Birger Teien Evensen, Sales Director – Offshore, at Kongsberg Maritime, said, “We are delighted to be part of this groundbreaking project with Bibby Marine, as they take hybrid operations in the offshore market, to the next level. Our integrated package of advanced maritime technologies will ensure the new eCSOV operates with unparalleled efficiency and sustainability, setting a new standard for the industry.”
The eCSOV will have engines running solely for charging, optimizing efficiency, extending battery life, and reducing emissions. A DC grid setup will minimize energy
losses, and offshore charging systems will allow simultaneous battery charging and dynamic positioning.
The vessel is expected to be delivered in 2027.",[],,"
