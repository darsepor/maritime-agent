EM 122 deep water multibeam for United States Coast Guard cutter Healy,"EM 122 deep water multibeam for United States Coast Guard cutter Healy 02 Feb 2010 Upgrade for high latitude research dedicated Coast Guard icebreaker. The U. S. Coast Guard has ordered a Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 deep water multibeam echo sounder for use aboard Healy, the largest icebreaker in its fleet. The United States Coast Guard has ordered a Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 deep water 
multibeam echo sounder for use aboard Healy, the largest icebreaker in its fleet. 
Although a Coast Guard Cutter, Healy is specifically designed for high latitude 
research operations in the fields of marine geology, physical and biological oceanography 
and meteorology. Healy is supported by scientists from various universities and 
institutes, so requires high-end hydroacoustic solutions, such as the EM 122. At a time when interest in the Arctic Ocean basin is intensifying, the new EM 
122 will substantially enhance Healy's ocean mapping capabilities. The scientists 
embarked on Healy are involved in a wide variety of research and several of its 
most recent voyages have involved hydrographic work related to determining the limits 
of the Extended Continental Shelf (ECS) of the United States. If the United States 
can prove that its continental shelf extends beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone, 
then under the United Nations convention on the Law of the Sea, the U.S. will have 
economic rights to the additional area. The only deep water system that met all of the criteria The EM 122 was selected by a third party consulting company that was contracted 
by the US Coast Guard to perform a detailed evaluation of currently available deep 
water multibeam echo sounders. The evaluation was based on several criteria that 
were deemed critical requirements for the new system and its application aboard 
Healy. After evaluating the multibeam products of various manufacturers the consulting 
company came to the conclusion that the Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 was the only deep 
water system that met all of the criteria. Unsurpassed resolution, coverage and accuracy Designed to perform seabed mapping to full ocean depth, the cost-effective, reliable 
and easy to operate EM 122 provides unsurpassed resolution, coverage and accuracy. 
The EM 122 offers accuracy of better than 0.2% of depth in deep waters and has up 
to four times the resolution of the KONGSBERG EM 120 in terms of sounding density, 
because of its multi-ping capability and ability to perform over twice the number 
of detections per swath. Healy, which is named after Captain Michael A. Healy, a famous US Revenue Service 
commanding officer at the end of the 19th century, is currently in dry dock in Seattle, 
WA to install the EM 122 and to perform other maintenance and upgrades, which are 
expected to be completed by the spring of 2010. The 420-foot ship is capable of 
breaking through ice that is five feet thick at a speed of three knots. Healy is 
outfitted for extended deployment and has berthing for 76 crewmembers and up to 
50 scientists. Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. in Lynnwood, WA is providing the EM 122 
and extensive engineering support as part of the ship's upgrade.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/em-122-deep-water-multibeam-for-united-states-coast-guard-cutter-healy/

KONGSBERG unveils range of next generation platform supply and anchor handler vessels,"KONGSBERG unveils range of next generation platform supply and anchor handler vessels Kongsberg Maritime has today unveiled a new range of ship designs in its extensive UT Design portfolio. The new anchor handler (AHT) and platform supply vessels (PSV) have the option to include alternative energy sources and fuels, such as methanol, ammonia, and hybrid-battery power. 06 June 2023 Text: Craig Taylor, Senior Manager PR & Communications Photo: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Kongsberg Maritime (Ship Design) Kongsberg Maritime has today unveiled a new range of ship designs in its extensive UT Design portfolio. The new anchor handler (AHT) and platform supply vessels (PSV) have the option to include alternative energy sources and fuels, such as methanol, ammonia, and hybrid-battery power. KONGSBERG has been a leader in the design of PSV and AHT vessels for 50 years, with hundreds in service globally. The next generation designs for both platform supply and anchor handler share a range of innovations to help ship owners addresture challenges around efficiency, emissions reduction and developing market requirements. The AHT and PSV designs have received Approval in Principle from class society DNV to operate with ammonia-fuelled engines and they can incorporate an offshore charging capable plug-in hybrid option, to enable emission-free battery-powered operation. Einar Vegsund Director, Ship Design Solutions, Kongsberg Maritime ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s iconic UT vessels have been the benchmark design for the offshore industry for the past 50 years. These latest designs combine decades of experience and the latest innovative KONGSBERG technologies to offer customers next-generation ships that are equipped for the future. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our ship designs continue to evolve, and changes to regulations and uncertainty around preferred fuels have driven the demand to create ships that are ready for the future and give owners the confidence to invest, knowing their ships can adapt to meetssels, Kongsberg Maritime, added: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A great deal of work has gone into ensuring this new range of ships gives owners a reduction in environmental footprint. We have drawn on the results of numerous R&D programmes including hydrodynamic optimisation, assessing offshore battery charging and in cooperation with Amon Maritime, obtained the Approval in Principle for the use of ammonia as a fuel. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½One of the great innovations of the anchor handler design offers significantly reduced energy consumption during anchor operations. This is achieved through the use of KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s cross-tensioning system where the load testing of anchors will use the power of the winches rather than the traditional approach of one or more vessels using bollard pull and engine power. This approach will lead to significant operational cost savings, enabling this crucial offshore task to be handled by a single shipï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The anchor handler rang bollard pulls of 180 tons for the small version, increasing to over 400 tons for the largest version of the ship. Anchor handling UT 7800 range The UT 7800 has been designed for initial operation in the traditional oil and gas anchor handling market, but it is very adaptable for future offshore energy developments, such as floating wind. See our UT 7800 range Fact Sheet: UT 7800 AHTL.pdf Martijn de Jongh adds: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The UT 7800 has been designed for initial operation in the traditional oil and gas anchor handling market, but it is very adaptable for future offshore energy developments, such as floating wind. While we are also designing ships specifically for the offshore wind market, the UT 7800 range has the benefit of being able operate at first in oil and gas, then, if desired, it can be adapted to serve operations in new, evolving markets.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ KONGSBERG offers a choice of winch configurations and capacities, as well as adaptable chain and rope handling and storated into the designs. For the largest vessels, the deck equipment and arrangement has been optimised for the larger dimensions and weights of the rope, chain and equipment than is typical within oil and gas, enabling operations outside these traditional markets. Platform supply vessel UT 7400 range Our platform supply vessel range includes smaller to medium-sized PSV vessels and larger multipurpose PSVs. These vessels are specialized for efficient supply and support operations worldwide. Se our UT 7400 range Fact Sheet: UT 7400 PSV.pdf Today there are hundreds of KONGSBERG designed platform supply vessels in operation around the world. The new PSV design range (UT 7400) has all the necessary features to address the latest regulations for the transport of the liquid products and the growing requirement for lower emissions and environmental footprint, including energy consumption reduction, and readiness for future fuel transition. The KONGSBERG PSV range of designs comes with a variety of options for the type of cargo, cargo volume and cargo deck area, which can be configured depending on the operational profile of the vessel. The cargo area has been re-designed and provides options for the various products compliant with the latest OSV Chemical Code regulations, ensuring the safe transportation and storage of hazardous materials, while optimizing the structural arrangement.

KONGSBERG Highlights Compact Acoustic Solutions and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles at UDT 2017,"KONGSBERG Highlights Compact Acoustic Solutions and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles at UDT 2017 29 May 2017 Advanced line of compact sonars for Anti-Submarine Warfare Largest portfolio of full size and compact Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for Mine Countermeasures Alongside the most sophisticated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) available for Mine Countermeasures (MCM), the KONGSBERG stand (C40) at Underwater Defence Technology (UDT 2017) 
in Bremen, Germany, will host Kongsberg Maritime's advanced compact acoustics solutions, which are used on small platforms by Navies in Littoral areas for diverse missions including Anti-Submarine Warfare 
(ASW), Search and Rescue (SAR) and MCM. A core focus for UDT 2017 is compact sonars for Littorals. The KONGSBERG product portfolio consists of several solutions for this purpose, suitable for installation on a wide variety of Littoral platforms 
including Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and AUVs, in addition to other small remote operated platforms. "" As the world leader within advanced acoustics and compact packaging of electronics we are able to supply disruptive technology for Navies that dare to take on new concepts,"" said Thomas Hostvedt 
Dahle, Sales Director Naval sonars, Kongsberg Maritime. ""We have supplied sonars for ASW in shallow water on small, fast patrol platforms. Our compact acoustic solutions enhance ASW capability by enabling 
the use of smaller platforms to increase sensor coverage. The concept is robust and forms a new disruptive challenge for attacking submarines."" KONGSBERG's Hugin AUVs will also be at UDT 2017. These sophisticated vehicles are used for MCM operations by several countries including Norway, Finland and Italy. They are an especially efficient 
platform, considering the dual missions of most mine-clearing vessels. During combat operations, Hugin AUVs localise and sweep for mines; in peacetime, they contribute towards bottom mapping and other 
hydrographic tasks. The two tasks are related, but require the high levels of flexibility and reliability integral to the Hugin design. The Norwegian Navy, along with other Hugin naval users, is a pioneer in the use of long-range AUVs for MCM activities. Using Hugin for these operations is inherently safer than other methods as personnel 
can stay outside of the minefield. Hugin and advanced KONGSBERG sensors provide unmatched data quality, while the ability to conduct fast and efficient operations with no surface visibility meets the 
strategic demands of Naval users. In March 2017, Kongsberg Maritime signed a contract with the Norwegian Defence Material Agency (NDMA) for delivery of four new, complete HUGIN AUV systems (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) for detection, 
classification and identification of mines. The contract expands the Norwegian armed forces' MCM capabilities, adding to the existing Hugin fleet in use by the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN) for over 15 
years. KONGSBERG's commitment to the development of Unmanned Maritime Mine Countermeasures is on-going. The company will launch a new concept in August 2017, developed in collaboration with Norwegian government 
and armed forces partners to expand the use of sonar and unmanned vehicles within the MCM operational scope.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2017/kongsberg-highlights-compact-acoustic-solutions-and-autonomous-underwater/
Successful Factory Acceptance Test for Simrad ME70 scientific multibeam echosounder,"Successful Factory Acceptance Test for Simrad ME70 scientific multibeam echosounder Delegates from the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea (Ifremer) visited the Kongsberg Maritime Subsea headquarters in Horten, Norway late December 2013 for the successful Factory Acceptance Test of their second Simrad ME70 scientific multibeam echosounder. 07 Jan 2014 Delegates from the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea (Ifremer) visited the Kongsberg Maritime Subsea headquarters in Horten, Norway late December 2013 for the successful Factory Acceptance Test of their second Simrad ME70 scientific multibeam echosounder. Ifremer is assigned the task of contributing to the knowledge of oceans and their resources, the monitoring of marine and coastal zones and the sustainable development of maritime activities, and the acquisition of the multibeam echo sounder was carried out to strengthen this work in the Mediterranean Sea. The Simrad ME70 will be delivered as part of the mid-life refit of the 'L'Europe' Research Vessel, prior to planned March 2014 sea trials. French research vessel R/V L'Europe (Photo used with permission from Ifremer). The delivery completes the already installed Simrad EK60 scientific single beam echo sounder system to create a 'standardised' package that combines quantitative single beam and multibeam systems for vessels that carry out biological surveys. Ifremer has also chosen the ME70 bathymetric module, enabling the ME70 to perform seabed mapping according to international standards while at the same time doing ecosystem surveys of the water column. Several features position the Simrad ME70 as fundamentally different from other multibeam systems. Uniquely, it has a built in calibration functionality in the software, made possible because the ME70 utilizes split beams in all beams. A calibration sphere with known target strength is used to calibrate the entire system, allowing the user to obtain absolute backscatter values from ecosystem components such as plankton, fish or bottom habitat. Calibrated backscatter data are also relevant for bottom classification, as backscatter levels can be compared on the same scale. Also setting the Simrad ME70 apart from other multibeam systems is its fully populated element array in both alongship and athwartship direction (compared to the Mills Cross configuration normally found in multibeam systems). A total of 800 individual elements in the transducer are used to form up to 45 split beams spread out in a fan in the athwartship direction. As individual beams are formed in both transmission and reception, two way side lobe suppression give side lobe levels lower than -35 dB. Coupled with Frequency Rotated Directional Transmission (FRDT), where operating frequency is shifted between the beams to avoid interleakage, the ME70 is designed to allow the user to measure weak targets close to strong ones, which is essential when your goal is to map the entire marine ecosystem. It is hence, a unique multibeam system allowing measurements of targets close to the bottom in the entire swath and therefore reducing the acoustic dead zone close to the bottom. ""Ifremer was the original driving force behind the ME70 as back in 2003, they awarded us a contract to develop the world's first quantitative calibrated multibeam echo sounder for their research ship, 'R/V Thalassa',"" says Tonny Algrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½y, Global Sales Manager, fishery research at Kong""L'Europe is a relatively small vessel, and in cases like this where only one multibeam system for various reasons can be installed, the ME70 is the only available multibeam system that can both collect quantitative data from the water column and bathymetry data from the bottom simultaneously."" ME70 survey of Blackmud Canyon, west of Bay of Biscay (Image used with permission from Ifremer). ""The ME70 has added another dimension to our biological surveys on board the R/V Thalassa as it addresses some of the physical shortcomings of quantitative single beam echo sounders such as low resolution and sampling volume. It has been many years since we started using the ME70 on Thalassa, but we have now come to a point where we standardise the combination of quantitative multibeam and multifrequency single beam systems on board our vessels that carry out biological survey and research,"" adds Laurent Berger, fishery acoustician at Ifremer.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/successful-factory-acceptance-test-for-simrad-me70-scientific-multibeam/

""The Information Management System delivered to Allure is obviously a revolutionary upgrade in data storing and a handling application that has a significant influence on our day to day operation. It helps us to perform our daily duties and continue with smooth ship operation,"" comments Dragutin Radobuljac. K-IMS was installed during a significant upgrade to the existing Kongsberg Maritime K-Chief automation system on board. The new K-Chief on Allure is one of the most extensive ever installed by Kongsberg Maritime, consisting 76 Remote Control Units (RCUs) controlling over 40,000 Input/Output (IO) points. K-IMS replaces the exiting K-Chief History Station and as the data logging system of choice on board, will provide data from 21,000 I/O points (up from 14,500) and data storage for 7 years (up from 1 year). This provides RCCL with extensive data and statistics with which to improve vessel operational performance. K-IMS provides the ability to review statistical data, condition based monitoring, alarms and events, and ship performance monitoring data. Condition Based maintenance on Allure provides a long term overview of the equipment performance and mechanical degradation, which supports preventative maintenance. Alarms and Events reporting provide the ability to review the most commonly repeating alarms and fix issues with equipment before they become emergencies. According to Hans Ellingsen, Manager, Information Management Systems at Kongsberg Maritime, fuel efficiency was a key driver behind the installation of K-IMS: ""The Chief Engineer requested a report which would show how much fuel was being consumed since noon the previous day. The report includes all the heavy consumers as line items so the data can be used to help with decisions about which consumers should be kept running and consuming power and which may be shut off. Consequently, the vessel can be operated at a lower fuel cost."" The K-IMS solution on Allure is a triple redundant data access and storage system with servers located in three zones ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ two on board and one in a hosted cloud service. This configuration enables RCCL management to access the vessel's data without having to use satellite communications, thereby saving on communication costs. A malware protection system to filter out any malicious attacks from the web or via USB on board is included whilst an admin server allows secure remote access to the vessel from authorised locations including the Kongsberg Maritim",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/revolutionary--new-kongsberg-information-management-system-for-the-worlds/

K-Chief 600 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ green consoles for SMM show stand. Vessel performance screen example. Kongsberg Maritime will showcase its commitment to lowering emissions and reducing fuel consumption at SMM 2010 by exhibiting a specially commissioned version of its new K-Chief 600 marine 
automation system. The K-Chief 600 on Kongsberg Maritime's SMM stand (#400) will feature green coloured consoles (for exhibition purposes only), reflecting the environmental benefits that the full 
integration of the company's newest marine automation system and the highly advanced KONGSBERG Vessel Performance System can bring. In addition to harmonising previously disparate vessel performance applications, the K-Chief 600 also utilises the new Kongsberg Maritime human machine interface guidelines that the company's 
enger the past three years. Based on extensive research of human factors, technology and structure, the new K-Chief 600 interface has been designed with ease of operation at 
the forefront, which directly translates to safety and efficiency enhancements during everyday use. The new K-Chief 600 system is highly intuitive, whether using the optional touch screen displays or traditional input methods, to access the vessel performance or the standard automation 
functionality, which includes: Full alarm and monitoring system, auxiliary control system, power management system, propulsion control, ballast automation system, cargo control and monitoring, HVAC 
(air conditioning) and fire system. As part of K-Chief 600, the KONGSBERG Vessel Performance System provides a set of tools that enables ship owners and operators to manage their vessels in ways that are more economical and 
ecologically beneficial, in compliance with safety regulations. Previously the tools have only been available as separate or standalone combined systems but K-Chief 600 offers them as an integrated 
vessel performance station, including: Fuel Performance Monitoring ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ With focus on the main propulsion system, provides an overview of the propeller, shaft and main engine for continuous measurements of fuel consumption and engine 
power output. It also monitors parameters for improving the vessel's overall performance. Engine Performance Monitoring ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Provides instantaneous status of the engines' operational performance through advanced cylinder pressure measurements, subsequent analysis of the combustion process 
and diagnosis algorithms based on empirical results and physical models. It enables reduction of fuel consumption, monitoring of cylinder load, calculation of CO2, NOX and SOX, reduction of 
maintenance costs and improved planning of maintenance, and reduced risk for engine damage. Energy Management ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Provides systematic methods to measure, register and analyse theth decision support that identifies 
specific actions that operators can take in order to reduce energy consumption. ""The harmonisation of our vessel performance tools into a single K-Chief 600 station, with very user friendly operation, is the natural progression of several years of application development and 
integration of sophisticated proprietary and third party systems such as AVL List and the fuel saver applications we introduced at Nor-Shipping this year,"" explains Ketil Paulsen, General Manager - 
Product development, Merchant Automation, Kongsberg Maritime. ""The result is a system that truly encompasses our commitment to the Green Ship and vessel optimisation, where software, sensor and

KONGSBERG Hits 100 LNG Installations Milestone for Innovative Information Management System,"KONGSBERG Hits 100 LNG Installations Milestone for Innovative Information Management System 30 May 2017 LNG vessel owners and charterers harness the power of data-sharing for improved vessel and fleet management The innovative KONGSBERG Information Management System (K-IMS) has now had over 100 installations for vessel owners and charterers in the LNG sector. The milestone represents a significant 
breakthrough for KONGSBERG and the K-IMS product within the LNG market and demonstrates the growing acceptance of the system's innovative approach to data-sharing for LNG vessel and fleet operations. As interest in data-sharing for operational efficiency grows in the LNG sector, KONGSBERG has conducted several successful customer trials to show the capabilities and benefits of integrating K-IMS 
in the last year. K-IMS is designed to enable continuous access to data both on board and ashore through an interactive web portal solution. The system unites all data logging and communication into a 
single, secure and maintainable solution, giving the fleet owner complete control of information flow and security. The K-IMS web portal provides visualisation of the data in a secured and controlled fashion, outside of the on board control domain. It features a set of self-service tools for live or post analyses 
of data, presentation and reporting. These can be expanded further with predefined KONGSBERG applications, with e.g., focus on LNG cargo and the complex process plant that manages it, as well as vessel 
performance and hull condition monitoring. While the K-IMS web portal is available through on board ship networks and at control centres ashore, users can also access the service through mobile devices attached to a network were the K-IMS portal 
is available, such as a ship's Wi-Fi and office networks, or via VPN. This flexible approach ensures that the vital data collected and stored by K-IMS is always securely available to those who need it. ""The LNG market has taken a lead in using data to secure safer and more efficient operations on board,"" said Stene Fï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rsund, Executive Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing, Kong""K-IMS helps to transform the valuable data generated by sensor and control systems into knowledge, helping ship owners to improve and optimise operations, and make fact based decisions to manage single

The annual UC was this year co-hosted by Vestfold University College, which recently opened a new research park featuring several KONGSBERG simulators. Approximately 150 delegates attended the UC, which consisted of lectures on simulator related training challenges as well as product updates and news from Kongsberg Maritime. With an overall theme of 'Maximizing performance', among the key topics at this year's UC was the training of instructors of simulator based courses. In order to ensure the best possible quality of its courses, Kongsberg Maritime places great emphasis on trainingw to conduct effective simulator exercises. Kongsberg Maritime Product Manager Training, Tommy Hvidsten gave a lecture on training the trainers during the UC, where he presented the various stages of competence. ""Our view is that learning is constituted through actual tasks that the student has to perform, which are then used as a basis for further discussions and learning. In this context, simulators are considered a valuable pedagogical tool, enabling training in a safe environment on potentially dangerous situations. However, exercises conducted must be both authentic and relevant, and relevant learning objectives should be the basis for such tasks,"" he said. Kongsberg Maritime's training is founded on measurable and observable competence objectives, describing what the student will be able to achieve as a result of the learning activity. A set of competence requirements has been developed to assess the learning outcome for course participants. In order to achieve this, the instructors must be trained in the ability to develop learning objectives, the ability to document observations as well as the ability to interpret the observation and do an overall professional and vocational assessment. Hvidsten emphasised a task based education as a means of reaching these objectives. In addition to the lectures, the UC consisted of a guided tour of Vestfold University College as well as parallel sessions enabling the participants to learn more about the topic of their choice and to get hands on experience with the college's simulators. Kongsberg Maritime cooperates closely with Vestfold University College, among other things through the supply of several simulators. The college recently opened a research park with a so-called SimSam lab featuring a 360 degree Offshore Vessel Simulator as well as a Seismic Vessel Simulator using Microsoft Kinect motion sensing technology. ""We always try to adapt the conference content to the participants' needs through the parallel sessions.

and endurance capabilities that together will stimulate a positive step-change in subsea survey operations for commercial, government, and naval users. 05 Dec 2018 Leveraging and improving on the power of the already de facto industry standard HUGIN technology platform, and its experience as a trailblazer in maritime autonomy since it pioneered Dynamic Positioning in the seventies, Kongsberg Maritime has created a game-changing new AUV generation that places data quality and its reliable and cost-effective collection front and centre. The HUGIN SUPERIOR platform packages the very latest technologies into one system delivering twice the area. It is equipped with the new HISAS 1032 Dual Receiver Synthetic Aperture Sonar (rox. 1000 metres swath at 2.5 knots for SAS imagery, real aperture and SAS bathymetry, with consistent resolution over the entire swath (typically 5 x 5 cm in mission imagery). The system also features the de facto industry standard EM2040 mk II multibeam. Configurable for diverse applications, a class-leading data suite with upgraded SAS processing, sidescan sonar imagery, bathymetry, sub-bottom profiler, camera, laser, magnetometer, turbidity and diverse environmental sensors for i.e., methane and CO2 measurement, ensure that the new HUGIN is as ready for field development surveys and pipeline inspection as it is for environmental monitoring or wreck searches. Contributing to improved data confidence for users at sea and ashore, the HUGIN SUPERIOR utilises sophisticated positioning technology, with in mission standard navigation rated twice as effective as other AUV platforms, including current HUGIN models. Operating HUGIN SUPERIOR now costs less with fewer external updates needed, and with new potential for concurrent revenue generation, further economic efficiencies can be achieved. The new HUGIN SUPERIOR also comes with a 30% increase in energy capacity on board, without changing form factor or size. While raising the bar in terms of extending mission endurance, the extra power available can also be used to maintain current levels of endurance while adding more sensors, increasing productive survey time and contributing even more to reduced OPEX. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The new HUGIN SUPERIOR AUV System is available alongside the existing HUGINï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ AUV Systems, expanding our product portfolio to cover all market segments and performance requirements,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Richard Mills , Director, Marine Robotics Sales, Kongsberg Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our new flagship AUV is designed to deliver superior data, positioning and mission endurance, enabling users to do more with a single asset than ever before. Ultimately, it can generate much more data for less operatio advanced techniques such as in-situ navigation processing and data cleaning.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Gunvor Hatling Midtbï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vice President, ",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2018/next-generation-hugin-superior-auv-raises-the-bar-for-subsea-survey-data/
Hydroid Introduces the New Generation REMUS 100 AUV,"Hydroid Introduces the New Generation REMUS 100 AUV The updated vehicle features, unparalleled technology and advanced capabilities 14 Mar 2016 Announcing the release of the New Generation REMUS 100 AUV / marine robot.

customers to have increased autonomy and creativity during missions. The New Generation REMUS 100 AUV combines the reliability of the original REMUS 100 AUV that customers know and trust with new features and capabilities, such as advanced core electronics, a flexible 
navigation suite with an exclusive conformal Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and an open architecture platform for advanced autonomy. The vehicle was created over a period of two years, and is designed based 
on feedback from the world's largest AUV user community. ""The New Generation REMUS 100 AUV has impressive capabilities not previously seen on a man-portable vehicle,"" said Duane Fotheringham, president of Hydroid. ""We are confident that we have created a 
vehicle that fulfils our customers' needs for leading technology, while maintaining the core offerings of the REMUS brand they have trusted for years. Thanks to the New Generation REMUS 100, we are continuing 
to pave the way for future unmanned underwater technology."" Design upgrades Advanced Core Electronics : The New Generation REMUS 100 features cutting-edge core electronics designed to replace not only the previous REMUS mother-board but also the CPU stack, emergency 
board and six serial cards. The new core electronics board is smaller and lighter than the components it replaces, and it uses an ARM + FPGA architecture that makes it both potent and versatile while consuming less 
than 5W of power ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ about 25 percent of the power required by the earlier version. Flexible Navigation Suite : The New Generation REMUS 100 includes an exclusive conformal design, phased array transducer 300kHz DVL in the rear of the vehicle. This design significantly increases 
bottom-tracking range to improve overall navigation performance. In addition, the REMUS 100 will now be available with a choice of inertial navigation system (INS) to suit each customer's navigation needs 
and budget. High Capacity Battery Pack : Equipped with two or three (depending on the mo 18650 Li-Ion based packs, the New Generation REMUS 100 AUVs will carry more energy than ever before. 
The packs use 3.2Ah Li-Ion cells and have the same electrical configuration as the REMUS 600 pack currently in use. Modular Elliptical Nose : The redesigned elliptical nose on the New Generation REMUS 100 can reduce drag by 20 percent. In addition, it's acoustically transparent, so that the acoustic communications 
(ACOMMS) transducer can be relocated inside the nose. Because the new nose uses the same modular interface on the existing REMUS 100, it can be easily integrated on both current payload modules and the 
New Generation REMUS 100. Open Architecture : The New Generation REMUS 100 expands on existing REMUS capabilities by adding an open architecture platform for advanced autonomy making the vehicle more versatile. This 
platform is realised with a publish subscribe database based on a Robotic Operating System (ROS) on a second processor. The new REMUS ""front seat"" performs control functions using well-tested, reliable 
proprietary control software. The ""back seat"" performs mission tasks, such as side scan sonar data logging and extensibility using Hydroid, customer or third party applications. The New Generation REMUS 100 is designed so that customers with existing payload modules can have them easily transferred to the new model. Hydroid will continue to support the original REMUS 100 vehicle 
for customers by request.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/hydroid-introduces-the-new-generation-remus-100-auv/

Type approval for Kongsberg Maritime's Bearing Wear Condition Monitoring System,"Type approval for Kongsberg Maritime's Bearing Wear Condition Monitoring System 10 Oct 2011 No open-up inspections required following Type Approval. Bearing wear monitoring system sensors. Kongsberg Maritime is pleased to announce that it has received system Type Approval for its Bearing Wear Condition Monitoring (BWCM) system. The Type Approval was received October 2011 and is according 
to Germanischer Lloyd's (GL) 'Guidelines for Machinery Condition Monitoring', meaning it is now approved to avoid open-up inspections, thereby reducing engine downtime and maintenance costs even further. The KONGSBERG BWCM system measures and displays the combined physical wear of crosshead, crank and main bearings, providing early bearing seizure warnings if problems occur during engine operation. 
It protects the engine continuously during operation, based on the latest specifications from MAN Diesel & Turbo including detection of sudden wear development. The sensors are specifically designed to 
provide reliable and accurate measurements over years of operation inside the engine. To date KONGSBERG has sold over 550 systems to new building and retrofit projects. Compared to manual clearance measurements, the BWCM will provide long-term wear data with better accuracy, higher repeatability and reliability. It monitors the combined wear of all three principal 
crank-train bearings at Bottom Dead Centre (BDC), using two proximity sensors (forward and aft) per cylinder. The system will provide an alarm before steel to steel contact, therefore helping to avoid 
catastrophic engine failure and the associated HSE risk, costs and downtime. Click to view larger image. The KONGSBERG BWCM system can be fully integrated into KONGSBERG's K-Chief Alarm and Monitoring system and AutoChief C20 Propulsion Control System, using the same uniform interface for easy operation and monitoring.

PROTEUS naval training solutions and POLARIS Ship Bridge Simulators. By combining these two class-leading families of trg solution based on a common, 
low-risk, cost-effective software family to provide a stable simulation environment. Customersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ legacy HLA-compliant and Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) compatible trainers can easily be incorporated into the PROTEUS INTERACT HLA federation, to optimise existing training 
capabilities and increase the affordability of this innovative solution for collective crew training. Additionally and where required, sophisticated KONGSBERG NEPTUNE Engine Room Simulators can be 
federated with PROTEUS INTERACT to provide completely integrated naval vessel training. This includes the effects of engine room and other engineering failures on tactical decision making by the 
Combat Information Center (CIC) and bridge teams, making a realistic whole crew simulation and training environment possible to practice a wide range of scenarios and to counter potential threats. Such scenarios and threats include counter-swarm training, mission rehearsal, after action rev denial operations, operations to protect the overall maritime infrastructure, 
and for many other naval, coastguard and maritime policing roles, including developing and validating concepts of operations. For the first time, KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s PROTEUS INTERACT connects together the bridge and CIC teams with crew-served weapon operators, lookouts, cooperating vessels, helicopters, aircraft, UAVs, threats 
and traffic ships that all operate in a common scenario. Individual POLARIS and PROTEUS systems can still be used as part-task trainers as required to teach basic operator and team skills or, using 
PROTEUS INTERACT, federated to create a powerful training environment for the whole crew and its cooperating assets, all in real-time. Trainers can be generic, as in the PROTEUS Action Speed Tactical Trainer (ASTT) and the POLARIS Ship Bridge Simulator (SBS), or designed to accurately emulate real equipment, systems and operating 
environments. PROTEUS software is already used in the Royal Norw submarine Command Team Trainer (CTT), and is to be used as the basis of the Royal Australian Navyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s (RAN) latest 
Hobart Class AEGIS Destroyer CTT. KONGSBERG has been a key player in naval and maritime simulation for more than 40 years and is widely recognized as a world leader in both fields. PROTEUS naval part task and skills trainers, CTTs 
and integrated naval and maritime training solutions are in service worldwide. KONGSBERG ship bridge and engine room simulation technology is currently in use by naval and merchant customers

Kongsberg Maritime: K-Fleet Voyage Application Verified for New EU MRV Regulations,"Kongsberg Maritime: K-Fleet Voyage Application Verified for New EU MRV Regulations 30 Aug 2017 Qualifying shipping companies must have CO2 Monitoring, Reporting and Verification plans prepared by 31st August 2017 K-Fleet Voyage meets all requirements while enabling reductions in fuel consumption and emissions K-Fleet Voyage, KONGSBERG's digital application for monitoring ship fuel consumption and emissions has been verified by Ecoxy AS for use under the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) 
and the new EU Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (EU-MRV) for maritime transport regulation (2015/757). Ecoxy AS is accredited by Norwegian Accreditation as a verifier according to ISO14065 for the 
ETS and EU-MRV. The regulation, for ships exceeding 5000 GT and which call at any EU port regardless of flag or country of ownership, aims to quantify and reduce CO2 emissions from the shipping industry. 
Entered into force on 1st July 2015, EU-MRV will be fully effective on 1st January 2018, when large ships using EU ports will be required to report their verified annual emissions and other relevant information. 
However, qualifying shipping companies must have monitoring plans prepared by 31st August 2017. ""With the first deadline under EU-MRV fast approaching we are committed to being at the forefront with a flexible, cost-effective solution for shipowners to meet these important new 
requirements,"" said Rune Kristian Stï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lstrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m, Product Manager ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½""Deploying K-Fleet Voyage is a cost effective, straightforward process regardless of if a 
vessel is already operating within the K-Fleet eco-system or not. Our solution supports customers to conform to the new regulations with minimal effort, while providing new opportunities to reduce operational 
costs by leveraging the extensive data that K-Fleet Voyage delivers."" K-Fleet Voyage simplifies the process required under EU-MRV with daily transfer of data from the ship-based application to the shore-office version, ensuring reliable collection of 
the information necessary to create the annual MRV report, including: Voyage registration, port registration with port name/berth, ETA/ETD and reason for call, condition and cargo quantity, daily registration 
of position, sailed distance/time, consumption and registration of bunkering with ROB values at arrival and departure for each fuel type. EU-MRV is a result of the EU calling for a global approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping. According to the 3rd IMO GHG study, maritime transport 
emits approximately 1000 million tonnes of CO2 annually and is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Shipping emissions are predicted to increase between 50% and 250% by 2050 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ depending on future economic and energy developments. This is not compatible with th 
goal of keeping global temperature increase to below 2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½C compared to pre-industrial levels, which requires worldwide emissions to be at least halved from 1990 levels by 2050*.

KONGSBERG Integrated Propulsion Control System Refit Helps Older VLCC to 'GoGreen',"KONGSBERG Integrated Propulsion Control System Refit Helps Older VLCC to 'GoGreen' 16 Sep 2016 Kongsberg Remote Control System, AutoChief AC600 installed and commissioned by a KONGSBERG Dedicated Refit Team The project reflects several recent VLCC propulsion control system refits carried out by KONGSBERG Kongsberg Maritime's AutoChief 600 integrated propulsion control system on a VLCC Kongsberg Maritime has completed an extensive refit of a 21-year-old Main Engine, Remote Control System aboard a VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) during the vessel's scheduled docking. The original 
Main Engine, Remote Control System installed at a newbuilding yard in Japan was de-commissioned and the latest Kongsberg AutoChief 600 was commissioned by a Dedicated Refit Team. The advanced AutoChief 600 is designed to manage all control, safety and alarm functions necessary for operating the main engine and all other accessories for propulsion control from a single 
station on the bridge. The system is based on a modular concept that allows flexibility in system architecture, covering a range from the most simplified to the most sophisticated propulsion control 
system available. A flexible and modular design makes the AutoChief 600 suited for refitting of older Remote Control Systems. The system employs an advanced, simple to use, Touch Screen Computer providing access to 
all functions and data. Main variables such as RPM, pitch, start air and scavenging air pressure, engine state etc. are easy to access while several levels of control are available to distinguish 
between user groups. The system uses a family of 'distributed processing units' (DPUs) interconnected by a redundant field-bus, which allows for flexible installation for newbuild and refit projects, 
as each unit can be positioned near the system to be controlled, into third party electric cabinets, connection boxes and on the main engine. As the most advanced Main Engine, Remote Control System available today, AutoChief 600 introduces significant opportunities to optimise engine efficiency and reduce the vessel's environmental 
footprint, including a unique 'Go Green' module. This advanced new system Integrates the AutoChief 600 with the vessel energy management system and navigation system enabling it to automatically 
regulate the Main Engine according to best practice and to optimise fuel consumption. When activating the new 'GoGreen' function, the AutoChief 600 automatically determines the optimal RPM command to be given to the Main Engine Governor, at all times. The signal is based upon 
calculations made from the ship and engine characteristics, and the predicted weather situation. Available for most engine types, the 'GoGreen' software, automatically performs system checks and 
ensures that all engine and navigation safety parameters are fulfilled, and provides a visible 'OK' for a 'GoGreen' sea voyage. As an alternative to the 'GoGreen' module, the AutoChief 600 Constant Power Mode ensures that main engine power output stays constant, in order to support lower fuel consumption. The system, which 
is currently available for MAN B&W MC-C, ME-C and ME-B engines, allows RPM to vary while keeping shaft power constant. The AutoChief 600 Constant Power function is designed to be simple to use and 
features a Power Mode switch and a RPM Mode switch, with mode indication LEDs to show when it is active. KONGSBERG installed its first AutoChief system in 1967 and almost 50 years later, more than 10,000 systems have been delivered to the world merchant fleet. The latest AutoChief technology forms the 
platform for diverse refit solutions for most low speed, two-stroke engines and includes fuel actuators, engine safety systems, and governor systems. By installing AutoChief 600, vessels with 
out-of-date systems can benefit from fully integrated digital technology, supporting the safe and efficient operation of main engines from all manufacturers.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/kongsberg-integrated-propulsion-control-system-refit-helps-older-vlcc-to/

It can reduce the need for onboard visits 
by KONGSBERG Service personnel, saving both time and cost while reducing downtime due to shorter response time on support requests. Kongsberg Remote Services are built on a common technology platform for KONGSBERG products. When installed on board Remote Services can support several KONGSBERG products on the same platform. The 
system is designed to address the challenges of establishing a secure and reliable remote session to the vessel HiPAP system via satellite communications. KONGSBERG's global secure network is developed 
in-house and all communications are authenticated and encrypted by a Kongsberg Maritime controlled PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) regime. If a user requires support, the operator simply needs to request to press the 'Remote support' button on the HiPAP Operator Station (APOS). The request will then be handled by a KONGSBERG certified 
engineer in a KONGSBERG Support center. The engineer can view the operator's screen and assist via telephone or text chat through remote services. Initially, the on board user cannot operate the system during the support session, only view the screen onboard. The next level in the process is to enable the KONGSBERG support engineer to operate 
the system, check parameters and other status information. Execution of specific tasks can be carried out. If remote operation of the system shall be carried out, risk assessment and remote safe job analysis will have been completed by the customer and KONGSBERG in advance. Remote operation is only done 
by a certified KONGSBERG engineer after onboard personnel have initiated and approved the session and the time duration is agreed. Typical tasks than can be executed by Remote Services include: Transducer alignment Transducer alignment analysis LBL Array calibration LBL Array runtime calibration Software Upgrade (cNODE) Configure new options HAIN alignment Post processing of DVL calibration Troubleshooting in general Configure outputs/inputs General System Check The onboard installation consists of a Kongsberg Remote Service kit that contains a pre-programmed router, malware protection computer and software for the operator stations.

Sensor Fusion powers safe navigation with new generation Integrated Bridge System from KONGSBERG,"Sensor Fusion powers safe navigation with new generation Integrated Bridge System from KONGSBERG New bridge system applies technology developed for autonomous vessels to deliver new levels of situational awareness to bridge crews. 05 Sep 2018 New technology from KONGSBERG's extensive autonomous vessels program will contribute to improving the operational and safety performance of manned vessels with the launch of a new generation of Integrated Bridge System (IBS), which is being presented for the first time at SMM 2018 in Hamburg. Through its work on new autonomous vessels such as YARA Birkeland, the world's first all-electric, zero emissions and autonomous container ship, Kongsberg Maritime has developed a cutting-edge, integrated technology platform designed to deliver complete situational awareness through the process of Sensor Fusion, where traditional navigation sensors such as Radar and Sonar are combined with cameras and lasers. While Sensor Fusion informs the autonomy controller of an unmanned ship, KONGSBERG's application of the technology in its new IBS for crewed vessels introduces a new level of awareness for bridge crew, by delivering a holistic real-time navigational picture based on precise data from diverse sensors. The result is seamless, user-friendly presentation of vital data and more effective operation of navigation, remote control and advanced manoeuvring, automation, energy management and safety systems. Already established as a technology-leading supplier of standardised and customised bridge systems for a wide range of vessels, Kongsberg Maritime has also further developed several key functions to deliver improved safety, especially in slow-speed situations. A new all-speed autopilot combes traditional autopilot and trackpilot functions with joystick and dynamic positioning into a single, common control logic, working from high-speed transit down to zero speed electronic anchoring or station keeping.

and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for a new REMUS 600 AUV system. The REMUS 600 will provide NOAA's Office of Coast Survey with full bottom coverage depth sounding data in conformance with NOAA standards 
for nautical charting. The REMUS 600 will be used to conduct surveys in navigable waters in port, harbor, and coastal environments. ""Hydroid is proud to be a part of NOAA's important underwater mapping efforts,"" said Christopher von Alt, President and one of the co-founders of Hydroid. ""This REMUS 600 will demonstrate the extensive 
capabilities of Hydroid AUVs and pave the way for the NOAA to use AUVs in future bathymetric mapping endeavours."" Coast Survey is responsible for acquiring hydrographic data for NOAA's nautical charting program, which provides navigational products and services for the maritime industry and recreational boaters. 
The REMUS 600 will be used to evaluate whether depth soundings collected by an AUV provide data that meet NOAA bathymetric mapping requirements. Survey plans are developed to ensure 100% ensonification 
of the seafloor, so the REMUS 600 will initially be operated as a test system aboard NOAA survey vessels. Once standard operating procedures are established and the data validated, it will be used for 
operational bathymetric mapping surveys. ""We are pleased to continue our successful relationship with Hydroid and we're confident that the REMUS 600 will perform admirably,"" said Rob Downs, Coast Survey AUV Project Manager. ""The REMUS 600 
evaluation marks a significant milestone in the advancement of nautical charting. NOAA maintains the public trust because of the accuracy and precision of its navigational data, and AUVs like this one 
will improve the efficiency of our data acquisition."" The REMUS 600 will be used to conduct surveys in navigable waters in port, harbor, and coastal environments frequented by vessel traffic, including commercial shipping, fishing, and recreational vessels. Hydroid's REMUS AUVs are modular and may be fitted with a large number of different types of sensors and have been used to aid in hydrographic surveys, harbor security operations, debris field mapping, 
scientific sampling and mapping, as well as many basic and applied research programs funded by ONR, DARPA and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense. With over 200 vehicles in the field, Hydroid is currently

Kongsberg Maritime completes K-Master FAT and sea trials for new platform supply vessels,"Kongsberg Maritime completes K-Master FAT and sea trials for new platform supply vessels 07 Oct 2011 New aft-bridge operator station integrated with DP and thruster control. Kongsberg Maritime has successfully completed Factory Acceptance Tests for the K-Master aft bridge systems delivered to Platform Supply Vessels built at Havyard.

Control concepts for DF-DE Vessels,"Control concepts for DF-DE Vessels 10 Sep 2007 LNG shipowners like the benefits that the dual-fuel diesel electric consept can bring to the vessels. Kongsberg Maritime has developed integrated control systems that manage the gas and power supply for dual-fuel systems. ""We've established a leading position as a provider of integrated control 
systems for LNG carriers"" ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Jon ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Fredrik Lehn ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Pedersen, responsible for Kongsberg 
Mari""Propulsion alternatives for modern LNG 
carriers"", identifies a dual-fuel system using boil off gas and heavy fuel oil as 
a popular new choice by ship owners. Of the 30 LNG carriers with non-steam turbine 
propulsion on order at Samsung as of December 2006, 16 featured dual-fuel diesel 
electric propulsion. Most of these will include Kongsberg systems to manage and 
monitor the necessary power and gas cargo supplies. ""We've established a leading position as a provider of integrated control systems 
for LNG carriers, which we've used to develop good solutions for dual-fuel LNG carriers, 
including reliquefaction and the propulsion control systems,"" says Jon-Fredrik Lehn-Pedersen, 
who is responsible for Kongsberg Maritime's deliveries to LNG carriers. With a separate department within ship automation dedicated to LNG deliveries, 
KONGSBERG has provided control systems to LNG vessels for more than 7 years. Kongsberg 
Maritime ensures the successful performance of its systems for LNG vessels with 
dynamic simulations. Through its full dynamic process simulator, KONGSBERG can test 
the design and functionality of their systems before they are put on board. Lehn-Pedersen and his colleague, Jan Simonsen (responsible for developing new 
applications for Kongsbergï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s integrated control systems, including dual-fuel), answered 
questions related to dual fuel deliveries: KONGSBERG has a strong order-book for LNG carriers. How many of these are dual-fuel 
deliveries? Are these more complicated? The gas-handling part, including compressors, vaporizers, heaters and separators, 
are very similar, except for the low duty compressor. Dual-fuele 
compressor; steam turbine vessels have a one-stage compressor. Dual fuel engines 
operate at much higher pressure (5.4 bar compared to 0.8 bar). Power management 
is more advanced for dual-fuel vessels, with a tight integration to the gas management 
system. With both boiler control and gas management systems, all LNG vessels involve 
complex control situations. What are ship-owners' biggest concerns related to dual-fuel propulsion? What 
are shipyards' concerns? How does KONGSBERG address these? Dual-fuel isn't as flexible as steam turbines. The boilers can burn the gas available 
and then use heavy fuel for their remaining needs. If the gas supply is too great, 
excessive steam can be dumped in the main condenser. Dual-fuel engines can operate 
on both gas and heavy fuel oil/marine diesel oil. In some cases, though, it won't 
be possible to match gas demand with supply. When gas demand is too low, excess 
gas will be buffered in tanks or burned in a gas combustion unit (comparable to 
the steam dump). When gas demand is too high, the forcing vaporizer will be used, 
like with steam-driven vessels. Shipyards and owners seek experienced companies 
in this field that are familiar with their challenges. KONGSBERG will try to make 
as flexible a control system as possible. We have developed special functions in 
the power management in order to have a more flexible system. What is the LNG market's willingness to invest in new solutions? For 40 years, the LNG market has used the same kind of propulsion with few changes. 
Now we have two new concepts: dual-fuel diesel electric and slow-speed heavy fuel 
oil engines with reliquefaction. Due to increased efficiency and difficulty getting 
staff trained for steam vessels, these new concepts are gaining ground. Big suppliers 
gain acceptance only after test running dual-fuel systems or by dynamic process 
simulators for reliquefaction. What are your observations from the delivery, commissioning and support of these 
systems? Commissioning may take longer since it cannot begin until all items are installed 
on the vessel. KONGSBERG is trying to minimize this time by having distributed control 
and direct supply to sub-vendors. For the gas-handling system, for example, we are 
supplying the control system directly to suppliers and they use KONGSBERG panels 
directly. This reduces commissioning time for the yard. For support, we see that 
with more and more systems onboard a vessel, it is a challenge. Maintenance crew 
onboard must be well trained to handle all the necessary systems.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/control-concepts-for-df-de-vessels/

AS. OSV crew are currently required to stand on deck to manually receive and secure bulk hoses used for the transfer of bulk cargo from ship-to-platform or vice versa. Kongsberg Evotec's unique BHSU system 
makes this operation much safer as the procedure is now coordinated and maintained from the wheelhouse and crew no longer need to enter the hazardous area. The BHSU device connects to the cargo rail and 
enables an operator to remotely handle bulk hoses. This negates the need for personnel to manually handle bulk hoses on deck, which removes the risk of personnel injury during bulk transfer operations. ""The BHSU has potential to reduce the risk of accident or injury during operations using bulk hoses, by completely removing the need for personnel to be on deck,"" comments Jon Olav Kopperstad, VP Offshore 
Subsea & Supply, Kongsberg Evotec. ""It has performed well during testing and is now commercially available, so we are very pleased to have been recognised in the early phases of the ONS Innovation Awards

Midlife upgrade of worlds largest pipe laying vessel,"Midlife upgrade of worlds largest pipe laying vessel 14 May 2009 New Integrated Control System and Dynamic Positioning for Allseas owned 'Solitaire'. Kongsberg Maritime has completed an extensive midlife upgrade of Allsea's Solitaire, 
which at an overall length of 300 metres is the largest pipe laying vessel in the 
world. The scope of supply for the upgrade contract, which was completed April 2009, 
consisted of new Dynamic Positioning and automation systems, to replace the Kongsberg 
Maritime legacy systems already onboard. Kongsberg Maritime was handed a broad remit by Allseas on winning the upgrade 
contract in Spring 2007; to upgrade all existing Kongsberg Maritime systems onboard 
to the latest technology. This meant changing the existing AVM, ADP703, and ATC 
3002 Dynamic Positioning and automation systems onboard to new K-Series technology, 
including K-Chief 700, K-POS class 3 and K-Thrust. The scope covered the changing of all controllers and rebuilding of all cabinets 
and consoles. Automation functionality was to be ported from the old Unix based 
systems to the new Kongsberg Maritime K-series equipment. The DP system was to be 
totally renewed to K-Pos 22 and 12 with adjoining independent joystick. The scope 
also included cable pulling and installation of new and rebuilt equipment. The FAT was conducted successfully at Kongsberg Maritime's HQ in Kongsberg, Norway 
and was immediately followed by an 8 week pre-commissioning phase in Egypt, where 
subcontractor Servie pulled approximately 20,000 metres of cable and installed much 
of the new equipment while the vessel was in fact laying pipe, without any downtime. Full commissioning started in Rotterdam late February 2009. This part of the 
project was extremely challenging as all eight Azimuth thrusters needed to be removed 
in just five days, in order to reduce Solitaire's immense draft enough to be towed 
into the yard. During the commissioning, which lasted 58 days including Sea trials, 
a total of 20 Kongsberg Maritime engineers with subcontractors completed the installation 
of the new systems whilst 300 people lived aboard the vessel. Following another five days to replace the thrusters, sea trials were performed 
on the journey to Norway, were the DP tuning was carried out under perfect conditions 
in Boknafjorden and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½yfjorden (Norwegian Fjords).The commissioning team consisted 
of employee's from a wide range of Kongsberg Maritime departments and partners, 
including representatives from Carpus (Kongsberg Maritime HQ), Bekkajordet (Horten), 
Mumbai, Kongsberg Maritime Poland, Kongsberg Seate""The challenges of this extensive midlife upgrade were overcome through close 
co-operation between everyone involved from Allseas, Kongsberg Maritime, the sub-contractors 
and the ship's crew,"" says Tor Reidar Kjosar Project Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. 
""All parties gave 100% which led to a very successful project that really reflects

Kongsberg Maritime and Massterly to equip and operate two zero-emission autonomous vessels for ASKO,"Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a link to the video instead. Kongsberg Maritime and Massterly to equip and operate two zero-emission autonomous vessels for ASKO 01 Sep 2020 The new vessels will replace 2 million kilometres of truck transport, saving 5,000 tonnes of CO2 annually Kongsberg Maritime and Massterly (a Kongsberg Wilhelmsen joint venture) have signed contracts with the leading Norwegian grocery distributor ASKO to equip two new vessels with autonomous technology, and to manage their operations at sea. With Norwegian companies delivering around 60% of the investment, this is a major milestone for the growth of sustainable maritime operations in Norway. The fully electric ships will replace 2 million kilometres of truck transport, saving 5,000 tonnes of CO 2 every year. ASKO ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ currently transporting their cargo by more than 800 trucks daily ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is committed to sustainability and is investing heavily in new technologies such as electrid transport is the single mode of transportation to link their warehouses on the western side of the Oslo fjord with their distribution centre on the eastern side. The new RORO (Roll on, Roll off) vessels will replace the current solution with a zero emission transport alternative. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have a clear ambition to be climate neutral and have set ambitious goals, including being a self-sufficient provider of clean energy and having 100% emission-free transport by 2026. These innovative ships are key to fulfilling that ambition and will form an essential component of a zero-emissions logistics chain linking our facilities,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ explains Kai Just Olsen, Director, ASKO Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Fully electric trucks will take the cargo between the warehouses and the ports of Moss and Horten, and in shipments of 16 the trailers will be transported across the fjord on the battery-driven vessels. This solution is cost effective, sustainable and will remove truck including the required port infrastructure ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ with 119 MNOK, in line with the Norwegian society's commitment to reduce emissions and transfer transport from road to sea where feasible. Kongsberg Maritime has a proven track record as an enabler for sustainable maritime logistics, and this ability has been further strengthened through the partnership with Wilhelmsen. The vessels will be equipped with the technology required for zero emission and unmanned operation by Kongsberg Maritime, while Massterly will ensure ship management and safe operations from their shore-based Remote Operations Centre. The two vessels will initially operate with a reduced crew, before moving towards unmanned voyages. Egil Haugsdal, President, Kongsberg Maritime, said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When we teamed up with Wilhelmsen to form Massterly, this was exactly the kind of project we wanted to enable. By working together with us to bring autonomous, electric solutions into everyday use, ASKO are helping tme operations while also demonstrating the efficiencies these technologies can deliver.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Thomas Wilhelmsen, CEO of Wilhelmsen Group, added: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The ASKO contract illustrates how Massterly is key in making autonomy a reality for short-sea shipping. We are proud to be the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first ship management company to operate unmanned vessels for commercial use.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Now we are one step closer to our goal of enabling sustainable trade: through cost effective, safe, and environmentally friendly logistics.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Since the ASKO operation lies within Norwayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s coastal jurisdiction, the Norwegian Maritime Authorities (NMA) must be satisfied that a sufficient level of safety has been achieved before they will issue an approval of operation for these vessels. NMA will therefore follow the project through a detailed risk assessment, based on IMO 1455 guidelines with regards to equivalent and aird party. The vessels, which are due to be delivered early in 2022, have been designed by Norwegian vessel designer Naval Dynamics and will be constructed at the state-owned Cochin Shipyard in India.

The areas are defined in real-time with SIMOPS and all vessels in the operation receive this information at the same time. KONGSBERG is introducing a new concept designed to enhance safety and efficiency for multi vessel seismic surveys at SEG Las Vegas 2012 (Booth #2106). By utilizing the SIMOPS technology developed for 
complex Marine Operations involving offshore oil and gas platforms and vessels, SIMOPS for SeismicTM is a great tool and aid in planning, monitoring and managing complex seismic operations such as wide 
or multi azimuth surveys. The integral, highly reliable wireless broadband network enables exchange of live HD video and provides criticalPS gives a clear and consistent operational overview on-board the vessels involved and also integrates with AIS (Automatic Identification System) to include third party vessels in the operational 
overview. SIMOPS exchanges data between the participating vessels in a seismic operation (seismic vessels, gun boat, workboat, chase boat). As an example ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a stabilized camera on a work boat can provide 
live pictures on-board the mother vessel by utilizing the SIMOPS integral wireless 'highway'. Further, the optimised user interface and display areas have overlays that in addition to navigation charts, objects and vessels can display updated ice charts and specialised information such as seabed 
maps relevant to the survey area. The data is managed through a SIMOPS interface on-board the master vessel and any other participating SIMOPS enabled vessel will instantly share the same information. SIMOPS also has provision for

From the 'Oden' ship's diary,"From the 'Oden' ship's diary 05 Mar 2008 2007.08.31 - Pirouette surveys of the Morris Jesup Rise Survey results courtesy ODEN - Click to view larger image. We continued moving towards the northern steep slope of the Morris Jesup Rise, where the Danish project has as a goal to map the foot of it. When ""ODEN"" is breaking heavy ice using all her 25,000 hp we do not get much depth information from the multibeam, only some pings here and there pass through the noise and crushed up ice, so a new style of multibeam mapping was invented, which proved 
to be very efficient in these tough ice conditions. To get good depth data we need either to break the ice as gently as possible or break a ship's length of ice, then back up while measuring the seafloor with multibeam. This is very time consuming. Instead we found that we could break through the ice along our intended track until we found some smaller cracks or openings in the ice where we could spin the icebreaker 360 degrees while collecting data. In this way we efficiently covered the seafloor 
around us with a radius equal to the multibeam swath. For example in 4000 m we could, during the most favourable conditions, measure with a radius of more than 10,000 m around the ship. Our mapping soon showed that the northern slope of Morris Jesup Rise was wrongly placed on available bathymetric maps and also incredibly steep. About Oden The Icebreaker ""ODEN"" is owned and managed by the Swedish Maritime Administration. It is built by Gï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½taverken-Arendal in Gothenburg in 1987, is 107 metre long with 19 crewmembers and a top-speed of 15 knots. It is fitted with the following KONGSBERG

New AUV LARS solution,"New AUV LARS solution Kongsberg Maritime has developed a new LARS (Launch and Recovery System) solution for its HUGIN range of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), which is set to bring about a series of far-reaching operational improvements. 31 Mar 2020 The new LARS solution benefits from the uniquely integrated combination of advanced in-house technologies which the KONGSBERG group offers, reinforced with years of accumulated expertise. After evaluating techniques and procedures in depth, Kongsberg Maritime has arrived at an optimal solution, namely to have the new LARS operating from midships, with the release and capture of HUGIN marine robots occurring beneath the sea surface. Launching and recovering AUVs under water, away from the splash zone, lessens the possibility of their being damaged, while midships deployment averts any likelihood of AUVs being run over by the launch vessel. The new LARSï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ subsea capabilities provide an extra benefit in that launch and recovery process much higher sea states. This reduces the risk of weather damage to marine robots, while boosting productivity to deliver significant cost savings. There are also tangible crew benefits. Operating the new LARS from midships will free up valuable aft deck space, and safety will be considerably enhanced as no personnel will be required to work over the stern in potentially challenging conditions. The design allows AUVs to be deployed from a hangar or container, and multiple robots may be managed from a single LARS. It is flexible with regards to placement ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ although midships is optimal ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and can be operated from anywhere on board, including the stern. It may also be installed higher than on the main deck, to accommodate the vessel layout. For deployment and recovery, the LARS cradle is lowered into the water to a pre-determined depth. It is positioned safely below the splash zone and propeller wash, enhancing both the weather window and safety, and is heave-cohip movement. Once in the water, HUGIN is released to start its mission. During recovery the AUV finds its way home to the cradle using the onboard navigation system and a KONGSBERG MicroPAP located in the LARS. Once nearby, the HUGIN drives itself into the cradle and is locked in before it is lifted out of the water. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ There is limitless scope in this new LARS design ,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rn Gjelstad, Marine Robotics R&D manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ It could of course be installed on newbuilds which are being commissioned by naval forces, where it would aid the deployment of marine robots in the execution of duties ranging from subsea surveying and Search & Rescue to mine detection and clearance. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ It could also be installed into an AUV hangar on a platform supply vessel, facilitating a broad range of subsea tasks related to the offshore oil & gas infrastructure, or even retrofitted in a containeriwhich utilise a modular payload system capable of accommodating a comprehensive variety of sensors, will transform commercial, oceanographic and military applications of all kinds. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For further information, contact Gunvor Hatling Midtbï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vice President, ",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2020/new-auv-lars-solution/

Shell commits to five-year JAWS / K-IMS contracts following successful tests,"Shell commits to five-year JAWS / K-IMS contracts following successful tests KONGSBERG is pleased to announce that Shell has just signed a five-year contract for the installation of its JAWS (Just Add Water System) software on board 45 of the LNG carriers chartered by Shell. These are LNG carriers which already utilize the Kongsberg Maritime K-IMS Information Management System application suite. 23 Feb 2022 The contract signing follows a successful year-long trial, co-conducted by KONGSBERG, Shell and the LNG shipping services provider Gaslog, on board the LNG carrier Methane Julia Louise . The vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s shaft energy consumption was recorded for nine months prior to the JAWS installation, as well as throughout the year-long trial with the JAWS software installed, and the trial demonstrated that JAWS could provide a significant fuel saving for the vessel. JAWS is a user-friendly hydrodynamic optimisation program, with no additional instrumentation required. It calculates the most advanions in real time based on algorithms developed from historic high-frequency vessel data. The system continually issues recommendations for optimal trim and draft, helping crews to cut fuel consumption and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. JAWS provides live data that allows ship and fleet managers to monitor and report emissions savings. K-IMS, meanwhile, is a web-based solution which gives both ship crews and shore teams continual access to crucial voyage and vessel data. The provision of JAWS as an application within the K-IMS suite renders it instantly available to all K-IMS users. The provision of JAWS as an application within the K-IMS suite renders it instantly available to all K-IMS users. Over the course of the year-long testing phase, onboard and onshore monitoring confirmed that the JAWS software generated substantial average energy savings of 5% when its recommendations were followed. This benchmark data was contrasted with performance data gathered from the sister vessel Methane Becki Anne , which followed a similar trading pattern. One immediate outcome of the tests was a commitment from NSML (Nigeria Ship Management Limited) to invest in JAWS software for 11 of its LNG carriers. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½JAWS has arrived at a pivotal time for shipping operations, when digitalisation is being recognised as a key enabler for an industry determined to cut costs, reduce emissions and enhance efficiency.

can be obtained by combining the images from several pings. The raw display image is available as part of the operator interface. An option 
to the SIS operating software allows storage of the beamformed water column data 
to disk. The Tasmanian Company SonarData has extended its Echoview software to reading 
and post processing the water column data files, and to visualize the information 
as 2D or 3D images. This new feature makes the EM 3002 perfect for surveying of fishery habitats 
to a max depth of about 150m, offering simultaneous and co-registered data collection 
of bathymetry, seabed backscatter imagery and water column backscatter imagery. 
Another interesting application may be wreck surveys, using the raw water column 
imagery to determine the minimum depth. The raw imagery will reveal masts or other 
small structures which may be difficult to map correctly by using the bathymetric 
data only.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2005/multibeam-water-column-imaging-/

Breakthrough for new Kongsberg Evotec Hose Protection System,"Breakthrough for new Kongsberg Evotec Hose Protection System -- As January 21, 2019 Evotec is no longer a part of Kongsberg Maritime -- 09 Mar 2012 Kongsberg Evotec receives order for a second hose protection system. Our Bulk Hose Securing Unit allows safe operation during loading and off-loading. Kongsberg Evotec, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime, has received an order for a second hose protection system, BHSU - Bulk Hose Securing Unit, for the LNG vessel 'Viking Queen' from 
Eidesvik Offshore ASA. Kongsberg Evotec developed the technology through Statoil's LOOP technology development programme in cooperation with Innovation Norway and Eidesvik. The prototype was installed and tested aboard 
the Viking Queen in December 2010. The prototype has completed an extended test program and the feedback has continued to be very positive. The companies involved reported that the BHSU system has supported human resource management 
improvements and achieved high operational safety levels. Currently, crew on board vessels stand on a cargo rail to manually receive and secure bulk hoses used for the transfer of bulk cargo from ship-to-platform or vice versa. Kongsberg Evotec's BHSU 
system makes the operation much safer as the procedure is now coordinated and maintained from the wheelhouse and crew no longer need to enter the hazardous area. This increases safety for both crew 
and vessel during critical bulk transfer operations. More information For more information please contact: Torkjell Ringstad SVP Sales & Marketing

In a first for the established technology-leading transponder range, KONGSBERG is offering the ability to log internal sensors and/or customers external sensors, transforming cNODE into a compact, self-contained subsea monitoring system, complete with data processing, positioning and data communication functionality. 04 Apr 2017 cNODE IQAM launches at Ocean Business 2017 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ stands N1 & P2 Provides dual usage for positioning during subsea installations and life-cycle monitoring cNODE IQAM (Intelligent Data Analysis and Monitoring) is an advanced instrument system developed for a broad range of subsea data acquisition and integrity monitoring applications for seabed structures, including anchor piles, manifolds, PLETS, welt can also be used for general environmental, leak detection, seabed deformation or subsidence monitoring. Data outputs from cNODE IQAM's range of internal or external sensors are logged and processed with onboard data analysis algorithms to provide the key events operators require. The intelligent data acquisition processor on board the cNODE IQAM is capable of running custom algorithms or standard event analysis based on simple statistics of min/max and mean, with set values used to trigger alarms. Internal sensor modules are available for cNODE IQAM to measure inclination, acceleration, pressure and sound velocity. External sensors that can be seamlessly interfaced include Kongsberg Maritime's Contros Co2, CH4 and O2 sensors, ADCPs, pressure sensors, inclinometers and current meters. More sensors can be added according to customer requirements. cNODE IQAM benefits the entire subsea construction value chain. It has the flexibility to operate as a standard cNODE transponder for LBL and SSBL position, allowing a seamless transition from subsea installation and commissioning through to long-term monitoring duties. Dual usage in this way negates the need for operators to source and install a separate, standalone monitoring system, reducing through-life project costs. Data is transmitted using robust Cymbal acoustic protocols to cNODE Modems or any modern portable, or vessel-installed KONGSBERG HiPAP SSBL system. Cymbal is Kongsberg Maritime's proprietary digital telemetry solution, offering numerous protocols to ensure the robustness of data transfer depending upon the environment. cNODE IQAM can operate with both internal and external batteries and features low power electronics and configurable sensor logging intervals to maximise subsea deployment time. cNODE IQAM can be built from a range of materials including hard anodised aluminium through to super duplex stainless steel for corrosion resistance. It is available in two sizes using standard cNODE Maxi and cNODE Midi housing designs, depending on battery requirements. "" While expanding the capabilities of the established cNODE range, cNODE IQAM also builds upon our existing subsea monitoring portfolio, "" said Spencer Collins , Sales Director UPM, Kongsberg Maritime. "" cNODE IQAM's dual usage, where it can provide highly accurate positioning at the installation phase, then left in place to provide on-going monitoring during commissioning offers a flexible approach that can help reduce costs and simplify planning for any subsea construction and monitoring project.

KONGSBERG wins $2 Million repeat order from US Coast Guard,"KONGSBERG wins $2 Million repeat order from US Coast Guard Kongsberg Maritime, a world leader in underwater diver detection technology, is pleased to announce that its Lynnwood, Washington-based division, Kongsberg Underwater Technology Inc., recently delivered a $2 million equipment re-order from the US Coast Guard for the USCG's Integrated Anti-swimmer Systems (IAS) program. The equipment contract follows an initial IAS contract worth $3 million and is administered through a continuous contract with the U.S. federal government's General Services Administration. 10 Jun 2008 Typical application for an Integrated Anti-swimmer System. Following 9/11, the US Coast Guard was charged with assessing the level of threat, and the capability to deal with it, within every US port. A large concern was the threat of malicious swimmers and divers to commercial piers, government and military vessels, cruise ships, terminals and other high-value assets. The IAS program was developed in response to this threat. KONGSBERG underwater surveillance system technology forms the basis of the IAS system and combined with software enables the IAS teams to detect, track, classify, localize, notify and respond to potential underwater threats. The system's processor captures a wide acoustic swath and then classifies the acquired contacts and alerts system operators to their presence. Sonar images positively identify whether the detection is a swimmer (threat) and not just debris, marine life or some other object. The system design is mobile and is deployed when necessary to protect high-valued assets and events. The additional components supplied by KONGSBERG will further enhance the US Coast Guard's IAS program and its future success. About Kongsberg Underwater Technology Inc.

New Simrad SY50 fish-finding omni-sonar integrates advanced functionality in a compact package,"New Simrad SY50 fish-finding omni-sonar integrates advanced functionality in a compact package A new compact fish-finding omni-sonar has joined Simradï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s market-leading product portfolio with the launch of the Simrad SY50. Designed with small coastal fishing vessels in mind, the medium-frequency SY50 nevertheless boasts the same advanced functionality which characterises the larger units in the Simrad range; a first for sonars in this price bracket. 15 Mar 2021 Key to the sonarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s suitability for vessels with limited space is an ingenious modification which sites all transceiver electronics within the transducer, negating the need for a transceiver cabinet while also reducing noise and simplifying installation. Only a single ethernet cable runs from the computer in the bridge to the power supply and the hull unit, which is sufficiently small that it can be placed on an installation trunk with an 8in diameter. The computer itself contains no fan or any other mo in humid environments. Additionally, both the computer and hull unit can also operate on DC power ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a godsend for small fishing vessels without an onboard 3-phase power system. Screenshot from SIMRAD SY50 Uniquely for such a small and competitively-priced sonar, the high-resolution SY50 offers 256 individual receiver and transmitter channels as well as encompassing features normally only found on larger items. These include single-ping transmission, giving a simultaneous horizontal and vertical pulse; FM transmission; and full beam stabilisation by internal sensor with electronic pitch and roll compensation, plus the option of connection to an external MRU (motion reference unit). With a standard operating frequency of 57kHz, the SY50 nevertheless allows users to choose any frequency between 54 and 60kHz, adjustable in 0.5kHz increments, which gives a potential operating range of up to 2,000m (depending on acoustic conditions). Similarly, the transducerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s o moved in 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ steps from +10ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ to -60ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, enabling users to automatically track fish shoals and survey the entire water volume surrounding the vessel. This principle of adaptability is also reflected in the systemï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s physical characteristics, by which the height of the trunk and the length of the transducer shaft can be calibrated to suit the dimensions of the host vessel. The transducer can be lowered to 40cm or 60cm beneath the hull. Sharing its familiar and well-proven Winson operating software with all other products in the Simrad range, the SY50 provides a clear and simple user interface, available in almost 20 languages. A compact operating panel can be easily and unobtrusively installed on the control deck of a vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s bridge, communicating with the computer via a single USB cable. Users have the ability to set up and save their own settings, while the system also allows for sonar data to be stored and resonar, and at such an affordable price,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Mads Diedrik Dahl, Vice President Fishery Sales, Kongsberg Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We wanted to issue a product that would provide new possibilities for budget-conscious crew on smaller leisure or fishing vessels who have traditionally tended to miss out on more sophisticated sonar features, and with the SY50 we think weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve achieved that goal.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The Simrad SY50 will be available for installation from June/July 2021.

World's first 'offshore' aquaculture development project receives green light from Norwegian government,"World's first 'offshore' aquaculture development project receives green light from Norwegian government The Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Fisheries has approved Norway's first development concession enabling Ocean Farming AS, supported by Kongsberg Maritime AS, to build the world's 
first automated 'exposed' aquaculture facility. Situated outside of Trondheim, this innovative new facility introduces a paradigm shift in salmon farming now, and other fish types in the future and is 
a significant step in Norway's efforts to deliver technical solutions to address the impending global food gap challenge. 05 Apr 2016 The Ocean Farming facility is a new and innovative design, developed to overcome the challenges of more traditional inshore fish farming facilities by being located in deeper waters, further from the 
coast. The submerged, anchored fixed structure will float steady in the exposed ocean and is suitable for water depths of 100 to 300 meters, where the aqua biological conditions are more ideal for aquaculture 
on 'the fish's terms'. The benefits of offshore fish farms are numerous, with conditions more suited to nurturing healthy fish, such as steady currents that limit exposure to sea lice infection. The facility 
is fully automated with normal operation requiring a crew of just 3 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 4 people. It can also be remotely operated. The project combines the best of existing technology and solutions from the Norwegian fish farming industry and the offshore oil and gas sector. KONGSBERG is playing a key role by leveraging its position 
as a turnkey supplier of technology and engineering services for complex oil & gas production units, offshore vessels, fisheries and sensor systems for oceans research and environmental monitoring. In 
addition to technology integration KONGSBERG is providing EIT engineering services, including delivery and installation of the gensets and aqualight systems. The Kongsberg Maritime technology scope of supply for the fish farm itself includes the K-Chief 600 aling a large number of different systems. Other highlights of KONGSBERG's 
role in the project include an extensive telecoms and positioning package, covering a range of products such as the Maritime Broadband Radio (MBR) for communication between offshore sites and to shore 
and precise Motion Reference Units (MRU). In addition, KONGSBERG is responsible for the AIS requirements of the project, through delivery of the AISBS610 system and associated AIS infrastructure. Below the water, sophisticated products from KONGSBERG will provide a clear view of the action. Leading the subsea delivery is the high-tech Simrad EK80 scientific echo sounder, a range of underwater 
cameras and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), velocimeter and O2 sensors. Other sensors include Tank Sounding and Water Ingress Detection. The subsea delivery is designed to accurately detect 
where the fish are in the vast water volume of the cage and how they move in order to ensure effective feeding. In addition, advanced 3D display of the fish and relevant environmental parameters will 
be provided to the operators. The project will be the first in the world to combine marine engineering, marine cybernetics and marine biology via a 'big data' approach fusing all the available underwater sensors and in this way 
offer decision support systems for the operators controlling and monitoring the feeding of the salmon and the overall physical environment of the sea. ""The Ocean Farming facility introduces a paradigm shift in salmon farming now, and other fish types in the future. With greater focus on biology and nurturing healthier fish, the concept delivers significantly 
improved yields that will prove important in the decades to come as part of Norway's strategy to leverage its aquaculture and offshore expertise to meet the challenges of accelerating population growth 
and the pressures this places on the world's food supply chain,"" comments Egil Haugsdal, President, Kongsberg Maritime. ""To succeed in placing fish farming in exposed areas as a viable solution to address the food gap challenge, we need to integrate and harmonise a wide range of maritime and offshore technologies, for 
the fish farm itself and the new vessels that will serve it. This is a unique, highly technical project where we will transfer our technology base and knowledge of developing for oil & gas production

15 shipwrecks found in dump-fields off the coast of Arendal,"15 shipwrecks found in dump-fields off the coast of Arendal Kystverket (The Norwegian Coastal Administration - NCA) has completed a two week mapping survey of a dumping area for chemical weapons in Skagerrak, 40 km south of Arendal. 15 previously 
undiscovered shipwrecks were found in the search area. 29 Apr 2016 In the aftermath of World War II, the Allies loaded decommissioned vehicles with chemical warfare agents and sunk them in various 'dump fields', one of which includes the area outside Arendal. During this year's mapping expedition, 35 shipwrecks in total were found in the dump field. 20 of these wrecks had previously been detected in 2009, leaving 15 new wrecks. See more pictures from the survey here at NCA's Flickr album Due to the size and age of some of the wrecks, it is believed that some of them did not originate from the dumping programme, and further analysis is being undertaken to confirm this theory. There 
is also reason to believe that this discovery confirms the previously estimated number of between 36 - 38 wrecks, although official confirmation will not be given before the final survey is completed in 
2016. Collaboration between FFI and NIVA The project has been led by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) and its ship ""HU Sverdrup"". A sonar on board an autonomous underwater vehicle (HUGIN) was used to scan the entire delineated 
dumping zone except for a small part in an area to the West. This area will be covered during the next survey planned for spring 2016, during which time zones outside the dump field will also be 
sampled. In addition, NIVA have completed a project to collect samples from the seabed in the dump zone containing scavenging organisms, hagfish and amphipods. These samples will be analysed further in 
order to give an insight in to what extent organisms in the area may have been affected by the degradation of the chemical products on board the vessels. These results will be available later in the 
year. The pictures give valuable insights The Product Leader for the NCA, Hans Petter Mortensholm, is satisfied with the first phase of the survey. ""We have now found further wrecks, and the upcoming survey in 2016 will provide the full 
scope of the Allied dumping after WWII. In addition, we can produce superior sonar images of the wrecks than previously, giving valuable insight about the state and distribution of the debris"".

The tug market is very important to KM and since last year the market trends have turned positive after the worldwide pause in shipbuilding due to the pandemic. Thmarket is looking very positive. KMï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s US series thrusters have been a popular choice for these, and in the tug market in general, which is proven by over 6000 globally delivered US units in the past 50+ years. The US series thrusters have evolved over the five decades they have been in the market as shipyards are searching for ways to cut both time and costs from boat building processes, and the shipping industry sets ever higher standards for performance. US Series thrusters now offer project-specific Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling capabilities, while the range of achievable propeller and nozzle combinations ensures the highest possible standards of operational efficiency. Another recent feature is the HD slipping clutch which enables cost efficient Fi-Fi (Fire Fighting) operations. Three of the 16 Med Marine tugs will also feature KMï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Pro-Duct nozzle . This high efficiency nozzle and propeller combination has been shown to provide higher bollat TK nozzle.

The new equipment will allow for greater variety in training environments and is also a qualified alternative to classroom training. ""The K-Chief portable classroom is stored in a robust Pelicase suitcase, which can be sent anywhere, from conference rooms to ships around the world. This gives the customer greater flexibility and 
is more cost efficient. Instead of the client sending their course participants to us, we can travel to them,"" said course instructor Frode Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½nningen. The portable classroom consists of eight operator stations which are connected as a K-Chief 500 network. They are also connected to a watch calling system and our Distributed Processing Units (DPUs), 
in order to simulate digital and analogue I/O signals. Both operator and technical courses The classroom is set up for both operator and technical courses. The first course will take place in Hamburg in week 12, and will last for three days consisting of one day of operator training and 
two days of technical training. Even though this portable course is a good alternative to classroom training, there are a f""In our stationary classrooms, we have access to more sophisticated equipment, like the fully operated PMS switchboard. We can also provide a tour of the production and test facilities as well as a 
visit to the customer support. The portable classroom does not substitute the 'in-house' training course 100% but is a very good alternative,"" states Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½nningen. A supplement The training department has experienced strong growth during the past few years, and the portable classroom will be a supplement rather than a substitute to the existing offer. With this new development, 
the department hopes to increase its activity. Rï¿½ï¿½""In a difficult market we have to look at alternative methods of selling our product, and the portable classroom is one such method. In general, we hope to increase our course activity and also to 
increase course participants' confidence in using our systems. Today, most operators only use the basic functions. If we can teach them to use all features of the system, they might solve more problems 
themselves.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2009/new-k-chief-500-portable-classroom/

KONGSBERG to collaborate with Ricardo on wind farm bearing monitoring technology,"KONGSBERG to collaborate with Ricardo on wind farm bearing monitoring technology 18 Sep 2014 Ricardo and KONGSBERG have today announced that they have signed a framework agreement that will see Ricardo support the development of the Kongsberg Wind Farm Management System (WFMS) as well as 
related condition monitoring systems for a range of other industrial sectors. The Kongsberg WFMS is a turbine independent decision support system. It surpasses the functionality found in wind farm supervisory control and data acquisition systems, and offers a modern and intuitive 
user interface based on KONGSBERG's wide ranging experience in automation and decision support systems for the defence, maritime and offshore oil & gas sectors. KONGSBERG selected Ricardo to support the development of the WFMS not least due to the company's expertise in wind turbine drivetrains. Crucially, this includes a deep understanding of the physical 
mechanisms of failure of drivetrain bearings, and Ricardo's extensive research into advanced sensor techniques. A significant aspect of the collaboration between KONGSBERG and Ricardo will be investigating the potential integration of the new Ricardo SensorLifeTM technology ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ to be launched formally later this 
month at WindEnergy Hamburg ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ into KONGSBERG's WFMS. Ricardo believes that SensorLifeTM could result in significant reductions in the cost of energy of wind farms. These savings would be realised through 
the more accurate prediction of the remaining useful life of key components and the consequential ability to reduce cost through proactive maintenance. In addition to the framework agreement, KONGSBERG has contracted Ricardo to further prove the SensorLifeTM technology, including sensor testing an""Ricardo's experience in drivetrains and KONGSBERG's experience in system development, sensors and automation systems are an excellent basis for this new cooperation.

This biennial conference brings together a diverse delegation of Kongsberg Maritime multibeam users, who regard it as one of the most rewarding events of its kind on the calendar. FEMME is a truly global affair ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ this year 170 people attended from 27 countries. The main conference was opened by Arnt-Helge Olsen, Vice President Subsea Sales at Kongsberg Maritime on Wednesday 17th April and the audience was treated to an interesting opening address by Larry Mayer, Prod Ocean Mapping/NOAA-UNH Joint Hydrographic Center at the University of New Hampshire. His presentation, titled An ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Almost Oldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Manï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Look at from Whence Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve Come and Where We May be Going, looked in-depth at the area of bathymetry and improving data quality. Other topics covered include the growth of ocean mapping ""Why canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t we map our own planet as completely as weï¿½ï¿½ï"" A big question certainly, and a presentation that really engaged the audience. Larry also played a part, as one of several joint authors, in the presentation that followed his opening address, when J. Beaudoin from the University of New Hampshire looked at Multibeam Echosounder System Optimization for Water Column Mapping of Undersea Gas Seeps. Papers with topics from different applications, both traditional and new were presented during the conference and all were at a very high technical level. Topics covered included logging, displaying and processing water column data, also referred to as mid-water column data, and seabed backscatter data. With new more powerful systems and technology the potential and the usage of these data are increasing rapidly, which was highlighted in papers throughout the conference.A lot of interest was also taken on how to ensure that the quality of the bathymetric survey was in compliance with the IHO S-44 standards, especially on target detections. To achieve this, the importance of good alignment and calibration of all systems was highlighted. This is especially important since the Kongsberg Maritime EM 2040 produces very clean and high resolution data, displaying more and smaller features on the seabed. ""More data and better data quality will have a great impact on the data flow and the production line from logging to finished products,"" explains Helge Uhlen, Product Sales Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ""Amazing results were presented, from pipeline inspection and shallow waters surveys to deep waters survey from different research projects."" Regardless of topic, several key aspects tied all presentations together; they were presented by experts to experts, and featured real technical detail that the audience could openly discuss and take away with them to help them in their own work. ""We were delighted with the quality of presentations from our users and Kongsberg Maritime staff during FEMME,"" comments Arnt Helge Olsen, Kongsberg Maritime. It gave us the opportunity to update our customers on new developments with Kongsberg Maritime technology but most importantly, it provided our user community with an open forum for discussing the use of multibeam technology and how as an industry, we can continue to improve our use of this vital technology.""In addition to the many customer papers, Kongsberg Maritime presented several new products including the new EM 2040 Compact, which is a small version of the EM 2040. Throughout the conference, Kongsberg Maritime took many requests for new features and improvements to its products, which it considers a key part of events like this.

Navy undersea warfare researchers to purchase additional REMUS 100 UUV from Hydroid Inc.,"Navy undersea warfare researchers to purchase additional REMUS 100 UUV from Hydroid Inc. U.S. Navy undersea warfare experts are buying another REMUS 100 unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) from Hydroid Inc. in Pocasset, Mass., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime. 23 Apr 2013 U.S. Navy undersea warfare experts are buying another REMUS 100 unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) from Hydroid Inc. in Pocasset, Mass., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime. The REMUS 100 is suited to marine research, defense, hydrographic and offshore energy applications. It is small enough to be carried by two people, and can perform intricate sonar and oceanographic surveys over large areas. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) in Newport, R.I., needs the Hydroid REMUS 100 for continued development and testing, supplementing NUWC's existing inventory of REMUS systems acquired previously to support a variety of program efforts, NUWC officials say. The NUWC is The Navy's primary research and engineering center for underwater and submarine warfare. REMUS is short for Remote Environmental Measuring Unit S. The REMUS 100 slightly longer than five feet, is 7.5 inches in diameter, and weighs 85 pounds. It can operate to depths of 328 feet on missions lasting eight to 10 hours. Powering the REMUS 100 UUV is a direct-drive DC brushless motor and an open three-bladed propeller. It can swim as fast as 4.5 knots and navigates by Doppler-assisted dead reckoning, Inertial navigation system, and GPS. Operators control the REMUS 100 UUV with laptop computer-based software for programming, training, post-mission analysis, documentation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. The software enables one operator to control as many as four REMUS 100 UUVs at the same time. The REMUS 100 is suited to marine research, defense, hydrographic and offshore energy applications. It is small enough to be carried by two people, and can perform intricate sonar and oceanographic surveys over large areas, Hydroid officials say. Typical REMUS 100 applications include mine countermeasures, harbor security, debris field mapping, search and salvage operations, hydrographic surveys, environmental monitoring, fishery operations, and scientific sampling and mapping, Hydroid officials say. NUWC is buying the REMUS 100 UUV sole source because Hydroid is the only known source that can meet Navy requirements of a UUV that is man-portable, has an energy density of at least 1.2 kilowatt hours, Navy officials say. Researchers plan to use the REMUS 100 in exercises that require a UUV that can move as fast as four knots for as long as 10 hours. NUWC officials plan to release a formal request for quote (RFQ) to Hydroid around 1 May.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2013/navy-undersea-warfare-researchers-to-purchase-additional-remus-100-uuv-from/
Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Promas propulsion system now av,"Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Promas propulsion system now available for navy vessels The Promas propeller and rudder system delivers increased fuel efficiency, better manoeuvrability and extended range for naval platforms 12 September 2023 Text: Craig Taylor Photo: @Kongsberg Maritime Kongsberg Maritime has concluded a research programme that shows its Promas propeller and rudder system can deliver a host of benefits for naval platforms including significant fuel savings, greater range and improved manoeuvrability. Originally designed for commercial ships, Promas combines rudder and propeller into one propulsion system Originally designed for commercial ships, Promas combines rudder and propeller into one propulsion system. Most naval twin-screw vessels use conventional rudders placed off-centre from the shaft centreline. Promas can deliver fuel savings of more than 5% which can translate into increased range, boosting the capability of naval platforms. The research, carried out by Kongsbergch Centre (HRC), has shown that naval vessels relying on traditional rudder and propeller systems can increase their efficiency and manoeuvrability with the adoption of the Promas propeller and rudder system. Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Promas System delivers fuel savings of more than 5% The HRC tested and compared the Promas bulb-rudder system, and the conventional off-centre rudder system used by navies on a typical naval aft ship dummy design. The dummy design consisted of an open shaft configuration with V-bracket and high shaft inclination angle to produce a typical wake field for a naval twin screw vessel. The tests compared propulsive efficiency, rudder forces, cavitation inception speed, cavitation, pressure pulses, and noise levels between Promas and conventional navy propulsion for ship speeds up to 25 knots. At 25 knots, the Promas system reduced power consumption by 6%. The rudder forces with Promas are also much higher. The system demonstrated less drag at small rudder angles aer angles than a conventional navy system. This improves slow speed and harbour manoeuvring. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve known for many years how Promas brings a quick improvement in efficiency for commercial operators, and this latest research demonstrates how these benef"" Patrik Kron Chief of Naval Systems, Kongsberg Maritime Patrik Kron, Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Chief of Naval Systems, said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve known for many years how Promas brings a quick improvement in efficiency for commercial operators, and this latest research demonstrates how these benefits can be offered to our governmental customers. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½By being able to demonstrate an improved efficiency of around 6%, for navies this means their vessels are able to extend their range, something which can be crucial on longer missions. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We know there is a large market for grey and light grey ships operating up to 25 knots, so our initial research has focussed on that speed range, but weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re continuing our research to consider how Promas could enhance the operational capability of combatants",,,12-Sep-23,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2023/kongsberg-maritime-promas-system-ready-for-navies/

the HiPAP subsea position reference system. 23 Mar 2015 Allseas' Pioneering Spirit single-lift vessel is the largest construction vessel in the world. Image courtesy of Allseas. Eight years in the making, Allseas' Pioneering Spirit single-lift vessel is the largest construction vessel in the world. Kongsberg Maritime has been involved with this ground-breaking project from 
near the very start, having been selected by Allseas to provide the Dynamic Positioning system for Pioneering Spirit (then Pieter Schelte) early in 2008. Pioneering Spirit's role as a platform installation, decommissioning and pipelay vessel demands the most comprehensive, reliable and feature rich DP and manoeuvring system available. With sea trials 
already completed in summer 2014, Kongsberg Maritime's Class 3, fully redundant DP system and other vital systems will next be put through their paces this summer, when Pioneering Spirit starts its first 
and particularly challenging project, the removal of the 'Yme' platform topsides in the North Sea. The Kongsberg Maritime integrated Dynamic Positioning and manoeuvring concept for Pioneering Spirit relies on a distributed and open system design, which employs a fully backed-up system-wide standardised 
communication network. The communication network integrates the K-POS Dynamic Positioning, K-Thrust thruster control, K-Bridge Navigation and K-Chief machinery automation systems, into a complete solution 
with unique positioning and manoeuvring capabilities required for Pioneering Spirits complex operations. Pioneering Spirit features two fully equipped redundant Kongsberg Navigation bridges with Multi Function Displays (MFD); forward and aft (in separate fire zones). The K-Bridge system utilises new Radar 
Transceiver interface technology distributing radar signals from the eight radar transceivers on a Local Area Network (LAN). This enables the possibility for long cable runs (500m) allowing for locating 
two radars in each 'corner' of the Pioneering Spirit. The K-Bridge system is delivered with innovative new features such as the ability to combine radar images from multiple radar transceivers and display 
them as a single composite picture. This eliminates blind sectors and provides a 360 degree view around the vessel. Kongsberg Maritime has also provided subsea position reference systems to ensure the accuracy of the Kongsberg Maritime DP, including the industry standard HiPAP high precision acoustic positioning 
system.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2015/worlds-largest-construction-vessel-ready-for-action-with-kongsberg-dp-bridge/

Analysis) joint industry project aimed at optimizing ships' fuel efficiency and 
therefore reducing fuel costs and emissions. MARIN is coordinating the SPA joint industry project, which kicked off in 2006 
after an earlier project, 'Sea Trial Analysis' or STA, laid some key foundations. 
SPA boasts some heavyweight partners, among them ship operators like Maersk, NYK, 
Hapag Lloyd, Stena, Wallenius, Wagenborg, UECC and Stolt-Nielsen, the DSME shipyard, 
suppliers like Kongsberg Maritime and classification societies Germanischer Lloyd, 
DNV, Bureau Veritas and Lloyd's Register. Tools for optimizing fuel efficiency At today's oil prices, fuel amounts to 50 per cent or more of the costs associated 
with ship operation. For ship operators, cost-cutting has become synonymous with 
cutting fuel consumption. It's not a futile endeavour, as the fuel consumed over 
the same voyage can vary by over 15 per cent, depending on a long list of factors. 
Ship design is the biggest factor in improving fuel efficiency but the SPA project 
has been started mainly to provide tools for optimizing fuel efficiency for existing 
ships. The focus of the project is new software that plots a ship's speed against 
the power applied to the propeller shaft, after accounting for a host of factors 
like draft, trim, shallow water, currents, wind, waves and more. Instant feedback ""This will give crews instant feedback, meaning they can make immediate adjustments 
to improve fuel efficiency. They can also compare a given voyage with the same route 
on another day, or by another ship, and thereby find a best practice for fuel performance,"" 
says Henk van den Boom initiator of SPA. Kongsberg Maritime is a partner in the joint industry project, contributing both 
its monitoring and display equipment, and its expertise. It is among a small handful 
of suppliers that, by providing systems for the project to turn data into crew-friendly 
displays, will incorporate the software into future product offerings. Green Ship strategy ""The SPA joint industry project for improving fuel efficiency is a perfect example 
of our new Green Ship strategy that we announced at SMM this year,"" says Morten 
Hasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, Vice President Offshore and Marine, Kong""Our integrated systems 
play an important role in optimal ship operation, including improving fuel efficiency 
and reducing emissions, but projects such as this will help us to develop an even 
greener product portfolio that will not only help ship operators reduce fuel cost, 
but will also lessen the impact of shipping on the environment.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/kongsberg-maritime-teams-up-with-marin/
Kongsberg GeoAcoustics Dual Frequency Side Scan Sonar used to survey underwater archaeological site in Greece,"Kongsberg GeoAcoustics Dual Frequency Side Scan Sonar used to survey underwater archaeological site in Greece Researchers from Plymouth University (UK) conducted a marine geoarchaeological survey off Methoni, Greece. The Kongsberg GeoAcoustics Dual Frequency Side Scan Sonar and the GeoPulse Pinger Sub-Bottom Profiler were used for visualisation of underwater antiquities over the local underwater archaeological site, within the GE.N.ESIS project. 16 Dec 2013 There is archaeological evidence supporting that the human presence in the Methoni Bay, Greece, dates back to the Bronze Age. In the summer of 2012 a survey as a joint venture with the Hellenic Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities in an attempt to visualise the nowadays submerged ruins of the prehistoric settlement, artefacts and historic shipwrecks in the site area, as well as the ancient harbour and its submerged breakwater. The research team carried out the survey at the very shallow water environment of Methoni Bay onboard inflatable boat. The Kongsberg GeoAcoustics Dual Frequency Side Scan Sonar Transceiver installed in a portable canopy and combined with the Model 159D towfish, was used for artefact detection and seabed features' mapping. The Kongsberg GeoAcoustics GeoPulse Pinger Sub-Bottom Profiler mounted flexibly over the side of the inflatable boat, was used for investigation of sub-seabed artefacts, investigation of geological evidence for the prehistoric settlement submersion and for mapping the settlement extent. The survey results from the side scan survey present digital sonograph records and geo-referenced mosaics of the submerged prehistoric settlement ruins, the ancient harbour and its submerged breakwater, as well as records of historic shipwrecks, cannons and artefacts over the site. The results from the shallow seismic survey highlight profiles of semi-buried historic shipwrecks, numerous sub-seabed features of potential archaeological interest and the existence of a dip slip fault along the bay approaches which potentially poses evidence of the geological process that caused the settlement submersion. The survey area off Methoni, Greece. Created Sidescan mosaics reveal the ancient harbour and its submerged breakwater as well as the extent of the prehistoric settlement ruins over the seabed.

New dynamic positioning course at Kongsberg Maritime in Houston reduces sea time training requirement,"New dynamic positioning course at Kongsberg Maritime in Houston reduces sea time training requirement Kongsberg Maritime's training center in Houston, Texas has become the first maritime training facility in North America to offer the Nautical Institute accredited Sea Time Reduction Course for Dynamic 
Positioning Operators (DPO). Kongsberg Maritime already offers the course at its training facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. The course reduces the time spent at sea required to achieve the Nautical 
Institute's DPO certification by up to 6 weeks, through more focus on realistic simulation exercises on a Kongsberg Maritime full-mission K-Sim DP simulator. 22 Jun 2015 Sea Time Reduction Course for Dynamic Positioning Operators (DPO) focuses on extensive simulator training (generic image). Sea Time Reduction is an intensive five day simulator course wherein DPOs can earn significant credit towards DP certification. During the course, participants will work with practical scenarios based 
on real operations, training on planning and executing specific operations under varying simulated conditions. The scenarios will be run on a K-Pos DP System Class 3 in a full mission simulator environment 
connected to an advanced simulator control (NI Class A). K-Sim DP is a proven simulator platform, providing highly realistic training in terms of operational processes and life-like physical consoles 
and visual system. In addition to simulator training on routine and emergency situations, the new course covers the study of DP incidents and the construction and use of worksite diagrams, electronic charts and vessel 
templates for use in DP operations. Additionally, trainees will learn how to prepare plans for DP operations, including contingency plans, whilst carrying out risk and safety analysis and defining the 
DP equipment classes. The course also places focus on the DP system's utilization of position reference measurements and the various position reference systems available. ""Training for a Dynamic Positioning Operator (DPO) certificate can be a time consuming process, which involves onshore courses and DP watch keeping experience on DP vessels,"" said Jon Holvik, President 
Kongsberg Maritime Inc. ""Training DPOs at sea is expensive and may cause risks, so replacing some of the time a trainee spends at the controls of a real ship in a safe, high quality simulated environment 
is an attractive proposition, especially for operators in the Gulf of Mexico, where there is significant demand for well-trained DPOs."" Kongsberg Maritime is the world leading provider of DP control systems and a leading provider of maritime training courses from its facilities in Norway, Aberdeen, Houston, Rio de Janeiro and Singapore.

Two new members to our HiPAP underwater positioning system family,"Two new members to our HiPAP underwater positioning system family 30 Aug 2006 HiPAPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ goes portable HiPAPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 350p portable High Precision Acoustic Positioning and underwater navigation system HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 350P is the only automatic beam steering portable transd""Vessel of Opportunity"" due to its ease of transport and set-up. With its new, unique and compact transducer accompanied by a built-in accurate Motion Reference Unit, HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 350P can be used on almost any vessel at short notice. The transducer is designed to be mounted on a shaft to be installed over-the-side or through a moon-pool of a vessel. With its 345 mm diameter transducer head, it can also penetrate all existing 12 inch / 350 mm gate valves. The system uses unique narrow pointing beam technology, to minimize the effect of noise from noise sources such as propellers and thrusters. The 46-element transducer creates a narrow beam of +/- 7,5 degrees, which can be pointed towards the transponder(s) in any direction within a 120-degree cone below the vessel. The operational area can easily be extended or changed by simply mounting the transducer on a tilted bracket, facing the sector to the wanted area. There is no need for extra calibration, or mechanical fine adjustments, as the internal Motion Reference Unit ly compensate for the tilt. New low frequency HiPAPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 100 is the new and low frequency member of the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ system family. With high accuracy, good repeatability and high reliability, the HiPAP 100 system is the multi-purpose acoustic positioning system for ultra deep water operations. The HIPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 100 system is supplied as an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ultra deep waterï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ version using transponders for high water pressure. Transponders with depth rating down to 6500 m are available. The HIPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 100 is well proven, and it provides the simplest way to position ROVs and other objects in very deep water. The beam forming, signal detection and digital signal processing are based on the same principles as the other well proven HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ family members. The elements are all computer-controlled and the system will dynamically control a narrow listening beam towards the transponder(s), mihe Super Short Base Line - SSBL principle, as the market requirement was to try to avoid the Long Base Line - LBL principle in deep water accurate seabed survey applications. The main advantage of the SSBL principle is that it only requires installation of one vessel-mounted transducer and one subsea transponder. The unique transducer technology along with advanced digital signal processing of HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ has been proven to obtain optimal position accuracy.

Second KONGSBERG AUV and subsea technology equipped Indonesian survey vessel ready for duty,"Second KONGSBERG AUV and subsea technology equipped Indonesian survey vessel ready for duty The second of two 60 metre oceanographic and hydrographic vessels designed and built by OCEA in France for the Indonesian Navy was handed over following a commissioning ceremony in 
Jakarta this March. The KRI 934 Spica, is the sister ship to the June 2015 delivered KRI 933 Rigel, which is already on active survey duty in Indonesian waters. Both are highly advanced aluminium multi-purpose 
ships, with 'Full Picture' technology packages delivered by Norway's Kongsberg Maritime. 28 Apr 2016 OCEA's unique vessel design and aluminium construction is ideally suited to achieving highly accurate survey results at speed due to producing less cavitation across the hull during surveying. According 
to OCEA's Director of Sales, Fabrice Epaud, this enables Kongsberg Maritime's hydroacoustic systems on board to operate optimally and deliver highly accurate data at speeds up to 15 knots, close to almost 
twice that of standard survey operations. ""Aluminium is smooth in the water, hence creating less bubbles, which will enable the Indonesian navy to get the best results possible from the KONGSBERG subsea equipment,"" explains Epaud. ""It's our 
job to make the best of the survey equipment we are installing for the customer, so we place a lot of emphasis on the integration when constructing a survey or multi-purpose vessel. The result is considerably 
more efficiency, which can save the customer time and money by completing more survey miles faster, and to a very high standard."" The Indonesian Navy's new vessels will be utilised to gain a better understanding of the seabed and waters of the Indonesian archipelago, so have been equipped with the most efficient and up to date 
technical and scientific equipment. OCEA worked in partnership with SHOM, the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the French Navy, to optimise the selection and integration of the hydroacoustic 
equipment in addition to providing scientific training for crews and technical assistance in Indonesia. The identical KONGSBERG scope of supply for both the KRI 934 Spica and KRI 933 Rigel includes a HUGIN AUV per vessel, EM 2040 and EM 302 multibeam echo sounders, EA 600 single beam echo sounder and 
side scan sonar, in addition to HiPAP hydroacoustic positioning systems. Both vessels have their own 8 m survey launches also equipped with Kongsberg Maritime subsea technology including the EM 2040 multibeam 
and EA 400 single beam echo sounder. The KRI 933 Rigel also makes use of an advanced Kongsberg Maritime Dynamic Positioning system. ""This was an extensive 'Full Picture' subsea delivery for two very advanced vessels designed and built by one of the leading shipyards in Europe,"" said Helge Uhlen, VP subsea Sales, Kongsberg Maritime. 
""We have worked closely with OCEA to ensure the vessel owner can get the most out of the technology we have supplied, helping them to operate effectively and generate precise results even when surveying 
at high speed. It's testament to the sophisticated design and construction methods OCEA uses and our on-going co-operation that survey results from the KRI 933 Rigel have already surpassed expectations.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/second-kongsberg-auv-and-subsea-technology-equipped-indonesian-survey-vessel/

"KONGSBERG develops Monitoring, Reporting and Verification application to meet new European environmental regulations","KONGSBERG develops Monitoring, Reporting and Verification application to meet new European environmental regulations 13 Dec 2016 New K-Fleet MRV application for Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Monitoring, Reporting and Verification enables shipping companies to comply with EU-regulation 2015/757 This vital new solution is ready for installation before the August 2017 deadline Kongsberg Maritime has developed a new Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Monitoring, Reporting and Verification - MRV application for its K-Fleet suite of Marine Fleet Management Software. K-Fleet MRV has been 
assessed as meeting the requirements of new EU-regulation 2015/757, which is a result of the EU calling for a global approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping. Entered 
into force on 1st July 2015, the regulation will be fully effective on 1st January 2018, when large ships using EU ports will be required to report their verified annual emissions and other relevant 
information. According to the 3rd IMO GHG study, Maritime transport emits approximately 1000 million tonnes of CO2 annually and is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Shipping 
emissions are predicted to increase between 50% and 250% by 2050 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ depending on future economic and energy developments. This is not compatible with the internationally agreed goal of keeping global 
temperature increase to below 2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½C compared to pre-industrial levels, which requires worldwide emissions to be at least halved from 1990 levels by 2050 (Source). The regulation, for ships exceeding 5000 GT and which call at any EU port regardless of flag or country of ownership, aims to quantify and reduce CO2 emissions from the shipping industry and 
demands that shipping companies have monitoring plans prepared by 31st August 2017. As per the new regulation, K-Fleet MRV enables monitoring and reporting of emissions on per voyage basis to, from 
and between EU ports, and is available for deployment now in new and existing K-Fl the CO2 calculations and report generation, K-Fleet MRV reduces the burden for crews to ensure that vessel's and fleets meet the requirements of the new regulation. The system 
combines data collection from on board sensors and manual entries, making it easier for events to be verified by the Master before reports are sent to the shore-office. K-Fleet MRV can be interfaced 
with other K-Fleet applications including K-Fleet Logbook and K-Fleet Maintenance, which provides for quality assurance of measuring equipment on board. ""With the established K-Fleet software suite as a platform, we have developed a straightforward, very easy to use solution that ensures shipping companies can comply to new mandatory requirements 
well before the deadlines,"" said Rune Kristian Stï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lstrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m, General Manager ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Fleet Per""In combination with K-Fleet's potential to help vessels 
and fleets to operate more efficiently through lower fuel consumption, K-Fleet MRV is an important development that will support the shipping industry to reduce its environmental footprint."" KONGSBERG's K-Fleet suite of Marine Fleet Management Software integrates diverse applications into a powerful system for ship management at the single vessel, fleet and shore-office levels. It is a 
modular software system designed to assist users' working processes within planned maintenance, inventory management, procurement, QSE, documentation, forms, certificates, voyage reporting and fleet 
operations. Built on an SQL platform, K-Fleet offers centralised and decentralised management functions and two-way data flow for fleets of all sizes.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/kongsberg-develops-monitoring-reporting-and-verification-application-to-meet/

of engine room systems and the way an engine room is built. However, our new approach, 
which integrates the ERS with the systems onboard, can provide an even better understanding, 
whilst at the same time offering more efficient training methods and logistics for 
students, shipping companies and training institutes,"" comments Leif Pentti Halvorsen, 
ERS Product Adviser, Kongsberg Maritime. The first version of this groundbreaking new simulator configuration is The ERS-L11 
MAN B&W 5L90MC-VLCC, which simulates a very large crude carrier with a MAN B&W slow 
speed turbo charged diesel engine. The simulation model is based on real engine 
data so when the Neptune ERS is run on the real equipment onboard the dynamic behaviour 
of the simulator is as close to real engine response as possible, making for an 
unmatched, highly realistic training environment. The simulated electrical plant includes 2 diesel generators, one turbo generator, 
one shaft generator/motor, and one 180 kW emergency generator. The steam plant simulation 
includes a D-type steam boiler, exhaust boiler, 4 cargo turbines, ballast turbine 
and condensing and feed water systems. Kongsberg Maritime plans to offer different 
versions of the simulator for different vessel configurations. As a leading marine 
simulation developer, Kongsberg Maritime already has a large library of scenarios 
and models that can be interfaced to a real IAS. ""We see this functionality as a very important development that will constitute 
an efficient tool for top-up and product training for qualified engineers and those 
already in a training program. By using the IAS as it is installed onboard, the 
simulation and real-life operation are closer than ever, and this is the pinnacle

Replica simulator The cockpit style bridge of the new Polaris high speed missile torpedo boat simulator delivered by Kongsberg Maritime. Photo: Kristoffer Ruud Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½geberg. The official inauguration of the new Kongsberg Maritime delivered Polaris ship's bridge simulator at the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy in Bergen took place this Tuesday, 25 th May 2010. The specially developed 1:1 simulator features a 
240 degree visual system offering highly realistic scenarios for officer training. It is designed as an exact replica of the bridge aboard the Skjold class MTB (Missile Torpedo Boats), which are regarded as one of the fastest warships in the world 
with speeds of more than 60 knots (110 km/h). The Skjold simulator features advanced software that simulates the Skjold MTB movements at sea and is interfaced to real navigation equipment, also gsberg Maritime, comprising: 3 multifunction displays including Kongsberg ECDIS and 
radar, 2 operator chairs, AP 2000 adaptive autopilot, custom made bridge consoles and a voyage data recorder (VDR) in addition to the operator panels and control systems for four gas turbines. Realistic training of high speed navigation and ship handling ""The Skjold simulator is one of the world's most advanced simulators for realistic training of high speed navigation and ship handling. In the hands of the skilled personnel at the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy, it will allow for world class 
training,"" commented Vice President of simulation and training in Kongsberg Maritime, Mr. Lars Erik Hilsen during the official inauguration of the simulator. ""This delivery represents a relationship that Kongsberg Maritime is very proud of. The Royal 
Norwegian Naval Academy is a highly knowledgeable and demanding client, which gives us new insight and technological inspiration. We look forward to continuing this collaboration and are certain that there are many great possibilities ahead."" The Royal Norwegian Naval Academy is a University College providing bachelor's degrees in military studies for officers in the Royal Norwegian Navy. The program is recognised for its combination of theory and practical exercises, and the Skjold 
simulator will be essential for training officers in navigation, tactical manoeuvring, decision making and routines onboard the vessels. Focus on safety ""The increasing focus on safety and reduced acceptance for mistakes at sea, make the Skjold simulator a very useful training tool,"" said manager of the MTB training centre, Captain Rune Andersen. ""The high speed of the Skjold class vessels makes 
it difficult to carry out all of the necessary training onboard so the simulator allows realistic training scenarios that would otherwise have been impossible to carry out. We can now expose the crew to greater risks in a safe environment."" Although the official opening took place this week, the simulator has already been tested for three weeks and has used the equivalent of 950.000 NOK in fuel, illustrating the cost savings compared to onboard training. As an experienced MTB 
operator himself, Andersen confirms the realism of the simulator: ""For one particular exercise we performed we had initially planned to perform 1/3 of the training on the simulator and 2/3 onboard. However, the simulator functioned so well that we 
decided to change the ratio to 2/3 simulator training and 1/3 onboard,"" he said.

Kongsberg Maritime establishes Cybernetics R&D Group,"Kongsberg Maritime establishes Cybernetics R&D Group Kongsberg Maritime has recently established a specialist 'Cybernetics R&D Group', whose main goal is to contribute at the cutting edge of research-based and market-oriented innovation across product areas such as dynamic positioning, navigation and automation systems. 30 Mar 2012 The group, which is currently recruiting new members, will mainly consist of PhD-level professionals in the field of engineering cybernetics. ""These efforts are especially important in today's complex society where increasingly higher qualifications are needed in order to distinguish oneself as world class,"" explains head of the group, Morten Breivik. Breivik has a PhD degree in marine cybernetics and previous experience as a researcher and lecturer at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Department of Marine Technology and Centre for Ships and Ocean Structures. Core competence for Kongsberg Maritime As an interdisciplinary field established during the Second World War, cybernetics takes its name from the Greek word 'kybernetes', meaning 'steersman'. This term was originally coined by the American mathematician Norbert Wiener in his book 'Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine', published in 1948. Feedback is a fundamental cybernetic principle which makes it possible to control the behavior of a system in a desired manner. A controller compares the desired behavior with the actual behavior and influences the system in a suitable manner through a control input. Historically, cybernetics has always been a core competence for Kongsberg Maritime. It started with sophisticated ship automation solutions from Norcontrol in the 1960s and continued with dynamic positioning from KV Albatross in the 1970s. Today Kongsberg Maritime is the custodian of this proud heritage, furthering it into a maritime world which is facing fundamental changes to operational concepts and manning solutions in the future. A dynamic positioning system is a cybernetic system which enables a marine surface vessel to automatically keep a desired position and heading exclusively by means of active thrusters. ""In the technical sense, cybernetics is about how dynamic systems such as ships, robots and chemical processes behave and how to control such systems automatically. Therefore, engineering cybernetics involves many disciplines including control engineering, systems theory, information technology, mathematics, physics, modelling for e.g. aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and chemical engineering, signal processing, image processing, instrumentation and navigation,"" says Breivik. ""Most central to cybernetics, however, is control engineering and systems theory. These sub-disciplines deal with basic cybernetic principles that cut across specific application areas and can be used for all types of systems. The other sub-disciplines then serve to support specific technology solutions based on these fundamental principles,"" adds Breivik. Increasingly important for the modern society Technological systems based on cybernetic theories and methods are becoming increasingly important for the modern society, being implemented in a rapidly growing number of products. ""Today, cybernetic solutions are used in everything from thermostatically-controlled heaters via GPS-guided tractors and chemical process plants to unmanned aircraft and submarines. For an increasing amount of companies, cybernetics represents a core competence which it is not possible to do without. This is particularly true for Kongsberg Maritime, which specializes in developing advanced control and automation products for the maritime industry. To be world-leading within its product areas, the company must therefore also possess world-leading cybernetics expertise,"" comments Breivik. The Arctic DP project aims at developing an efficient ice management system to aid DP operations in ice-rich areas. Such a system consists of several subsystems, including an ice observation system using unmanned aerial vehicles and an ice load reduction system using ice breakers to grind the ice approaching a DP vessel. The cybernetics group will focus on developing solutions for both manned and unmanned vessels. For example, automated marine operations where humans only play a general supervisory role will become increasingly important, especially in connection with activities in the Arctic. As a result, the group already participates in a research project together with NTNU, Statoil and DNV called 'Arctic DP: Safe and Green Dynamic Positioning Operations of Offshore Vessels in an Arctic Environment'. ""In short, the group will contribute to research-based and market-oriented innovation so that Kongsberg Maritime retains and further develops its position as a world leader in maritime technology based on cybernetic theory and methods,"" continues Breivik. ""This initiative represents a unique opportunity for ambitious cybernetics professionals to gather in a leading professional community to work with exciting and challenging R&D problems in applied maritime cybernetics, and to be able to follow their solutions all the way from newly hatched ideas into finished market products. Our ultimate goal is to be able to develop products that meet needs the market has not even thought about in advance,"" says Breivik.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2012/kongsberg-maritime-establishes-cybernetics-rd-group/
Trial by fire for New Spanish Research Vessel,"Trial by fire for New Spanish Research Vessel 14 Nov 2011 The new multi-purpose research vessel R/V Ramï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n Margalef. The new multi-purpose research vessel R/V Ramï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n Margalef, which belongs to the Spanish Oceanographic Institute (IEO), was undergoing sea trials when the Science Ministry decided to move it to the Canary 
Islands to follow up on the activity of the volcano on El Hierro Island. The vessel was only delivered a few weeks previously, on 23 of September 2011, so with such a challenging first mission, this really 
was a trial by fire. During the first week of the mission, the goal was to map the volcano so researchers had a clear view of its footprint. It didn't take long for the team to build a good picture of the volcano using 
the data acquired with the Kongsberg EM 710 multibeam echo sounder system installed on board R/V Ramï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n Margalef. After the volcano was located, the EM 710 was used to measure dimensions such as cone height from the bottom and  dataset from the same area acquired 
on board R/V Hespï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rides using the Kongsberg EM 12 in 1998, in order to calculate how much the volcano had risen. The team then went on to research the gasses and water column using the six different frequencies of the Simrad EK60 scientific echosounder and Simrad ME70 scientific multibeam echosounder. Once the area was fully 
mapped the ROV operations started, which enabled the team to view high quality video of the sea bottom around the volcano captured by HD cameras supplied by Kongsberg Maritime in Aberdeen. The vessel is normally performing different oceanography missions launching various sensors, with vessel navigation supported by Kongsberg Maritime's K-Pos Dynamic Positioning and K-Bridge Integrated 
Bridge System. So not only was this first mission a trial by fire for R/V Ramï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n Margalef, but the Kongsberg Maritime Full Picture delivery onboard has been put through its paces too. The systems performed reliably 
and accurately fromo acquire the data they needed to make the first mission for R/V Ramï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n Margalef a great success. This screen capture shows the location of the volcano. It is taken from the Kongsberg EM 170 hydrographic multibeam echo sounder. Image courtesy of R/V Ramï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n Margalef.

Estonian Ministry of Defence to acquire two REMUS 100 Unmanned Underwater Vehicles,"Estonian Ministry of Defence to acquire two REMUS 100 Unmanned Underwater Vehicles REMUS sophisticated sensor and navigation capability needed to accomplish MCM priorities. 21 Nov 2008 Estonian Ministry of Defence has signed a contract to acquire two lightweight REMUS 100 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Hydroid, Inc. a leading manufacturer of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) announces that the Estonian Ministry of Defence has signed a contract to acquire two lightweight REMUS 100 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). As a member of NATO since 2004, the Estonian Navy's top priority is the development of mine countermeasure capability and the REMUS 100 is ideally suited to meet this requirement. ""We welcome the Estonian Navy as the latest addition to the growing number of navies now leveraging the REMUS capability for both Organic and Dedicated Mine Countermeasure operations. The REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle technology enables fast, accurate and safer operations,"" commented Graham Lester Director, Hydroid Europe. During World War I and II, more than 80,000 sea mines were laid in the Baltic Sea. Since 1995, a number of mine clearance operations have been carried out in Estonian waters in close co-operation with other navies of the Baltic Sea region, in order to find and dispose of these ordnances. Finding the ordnances has been a potentially dangerous task to all involved, but soon can be accomplished safely by only one-man deploying and operating the compact REMUS 100. Over the past six years, Hydroid, the NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC), in La Spezia, Italy, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), have widely demonstrated the REMUS technology throughout NATO. In June, the Estonian Navy had the opportunity, as participants in BALTOPS 2008, to see how the REMUS worked as part of an exercise to improve interoperability with NATO and PFP nations by conducting peace support operations at sea, including gunnery exercises, replenishment-at-sea, undersea warfare, radar tracking, mine countermeasures, seamanship, search and rescue, maritime interdiction operations and scenarios dealing with potential real world crises and maritime security. Thirteen other nations participated in this exercise. ""We are pleased that the Estonian Navy has confidence in Hydroid and our REMUS technology. Once the systems are accepted for in-service use, the Estonian Navy will become the seventh NATO Navy to include REMUS in their complement of systems used to conduct expeditionary shallow water mine countermeasure operations. We are confident that the REMUS systems will meet the operational expectations of the Navy,"" stated Kevin McCarthy, Vice President Marketing & Sales of Hydroid. Hydroid's AUVs are being used by many navies around the world, including the U.S. Navy, Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, Republic of Singapore Navy, German Navy Test Lab, Royal Norwegian Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy and the Belgian Navy.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/estonian-ministry-of-defence-to-acquire-two-remus-100-unmanned-underwater/
Kongsberg Maritime releases new Dual Fuel Diesel Electric Engine Room Simulator Model,"Kongsberg Maritime releases new Dual Fuel Diesel Electric Engine Room Simulator Model 09 Dec 2011 Ongoing simulation model development focuses on vessel efficiency. The new engine room simulator model has been designed to meet the growing training demands for DFDE propulsion aboard both LNG carriers and other vessels. The model includes four Dual Fuel Generators. Kongsberg Maritime has released a sophisticated Engine Room Simulator (ERS) model based on a Dual Fuel Diesel Electric (DFDE) Engine Room configuration from a modern liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
carrier. The new DFDE model will offer the most sophisticated simulator training for LNG engineers available today. DFDE driven vessels are becoming more and more common and the new engine room simulator model has been designed to meet the growing training demands for DFDE propulsion 
aboard both LNG carriers and other vessels, in order to meet the requirements for SOx reduction set by the IMO. ""The training requirement for Dual Fuel engines is growing rapidly,"" explains Leif Pentti Halvorsen, Product Manager for Engine Room Simulators, Kongsberg Maritime. ""Of the 30 LNG carriers with 
non-steam turbine propulsion on order at Samsung as of December 2006, 16 featured DFDE propulsion. Since then, the share of new LNG carriers with DFDE propulsion systems has grown to be the majority 
of all new LNG carrier buildings."" ""According to LNG world shipping statistics of all LNG carriers on order, 36 out of 49 have a DFDE configuration [As of July 2011]. KONGSBERG K-chief systems are used to manage and monitor the necessary power and 
gas cargo supplies on board, so we have an excellent foundation for the new DFDE ERS model."" The simulated ship has two propulsion motors geared together to one fixed pitch propeller. In addition to sophisticated propulsion control and power management systems, the model includes four Dual 
Fuel Generators (6.6kV), one bow thruster, and a number of ship service and gas handling consumers, both low and high voltage. With Kongsberg Maritime's new simulator model, students can train on dual fuel engines, learning how Boil Off Gas (BOG) can be used in an effective plant and in a diesel electric combination that 
provides great flexibility compared to a steam plant. In addition to gaining a full understanding of DFDE engines, training scenarios on potential energy saving can be created, which is a key aspect, 
considering the current cost of fuel and the fact that a DFDE plant has much better efficiency than a traditional steam plant. Kongsberg Maritime is committed to supporting the shipping industry in reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency. The new DFDE model is the latest in a long line of new ERS models, including 
one developed for the RT-flex engine, which reflect the diverse approach the Kongsberg Maritime Simulation & Training department has towards enabling the Green Ship.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/kongsberg-maritime-releases-new-dual-fuel-diesel-electric-engine-room-simulator/
KONGSBERG introduces new Diver Detection Sonars,"KONGSBERG introduces new Diver Detection Sonars 05 Jun 2007 The Evolution of Underwater Security DDS 9000T Series Diver Detection Sonar. Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd., announced today the release of their new DDS 9000T Series 
Diver Detection Sonar. Two new models, the DDS 9000 and DDS 9001 operate at 90 kHz 
frequency, the optimum frequency for diver detection. Initially KONGSBERG is offering 
these two models with 200 degrees and 360 degrees of horizontal coverage, respectively. 
Different options expand the range to more than sixteen different configurations. 
Two levels of operator interfaces are offered with the DDS 9000 series, a basic 
sonar processor and a sophisticated target tracking processor that can be expanded 
to serve up to 10 systems using Ethernet connections. Max Muntener, Engineering Manager for Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd. states, ""The DDS 
series is the culmination of a long term, very extensive development effort. We 
are fortunate to have the resources and technical expertise to enable continued 
development for what has been a very successful product line."" Meets US Homeland Security's requirement Kongsberg has delivered unparalleled value with the DDS 9000 Series. Users across 
all markets have been demanding an improvement in the performance of diver detection 
systems relative to price. A number of different configurations of the DDS 9000 
200 degree sonar meet the US Department of Homeland Security's requirement for a 
price of less than $100,000 per 1,000 feet of protected shoreline. These configurations 
provide over 3,300 feet of shoreline coverage, and sell for less than US $300,000. 
360 degree configurations are available for less than $ 400,000. For both military and civilian markets Deployment flexibility has been an important criteria from the start of this 
project. Clients in both military and civilian markets stressed the need for smaller, 
lighter systems. The DDS 9001T with a complete 360 degree sonar head weighing less 
than 250 pounds, is less than half the weight of competing units. A range of options 
enables these systems to be readily deployed in shipborne, pier side and sea bottom 
mounted configurations. Reliability is another area addressed by KONGSBERG in the development of this 
product. Kongsberg products are renowned for their reliability in the field - the 
result of extensive testing and unrivalled technical experience. Kongsberg's global 
service network is both accessible and responsive. Kongsberg backs this up with 
a 24 month repair or replacement warranty on all system components. Nader Riahi, President of Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd. says, ""The DDS 9000 series 
truly represents the Evolution of Underwater Security, offering greater value, increased 
flexibility, an improved operator interface and greater reliability."" About Kongsberg Mesotech Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd. (KML) is part of Kongsberg Maritime subsea division. KML supplies

New research project set to prove 'less is more' for Offshore Operational Safety,"New research project set to prove 'less is more' for Offshore Operational Safety 16 Jan 2012 Next generation solutions to focus on maximising operational performance and safety through user-centred design and simplification. The SITUMAR project intends to alter the trend of growing complexity in marine systems by a user centred design approach that simplifies the technical systems. Global marine technology developer Kongsberg Maritime will lead a new research project called 'Situation Awareness and Decision Support Tools for demanding marine operations' (SITUMAR), which kicks-off 
on February 2 nd 2012. Part-funded by the Norwegian Research Council and undertaken in collaboration with academic research partners Chalmers University in Sweden, Vestfold University College and Haugesund 
University College in Norway, the new project has been implemented as the foundation for a new generation of support systems and solutions for marine operations. Advanced and demanding marine operations have become more challenging (deeper waters, heavier loads, harsher environments) and control systems and organisations have consequently become more complicated. 
The trend has been to add more technology, functionality and routines to the technical system and today, there is a vast gap between the data available to the user and the information really needed. The SITUMAR project intends to alter the trend of growing complexity in marine systems by a user centred design (UCD) approach that simplifies the technical systems and interfaces and changes the 
focus from technology centred to human and task centred design processes. The research project will provide the solid scientific basis to achieve this. ""We will start with a literature study followed by detailed analysis of one or two advanced marine operations and a System Design Specification. A prototype will be built and implemented in a simulator 
environment where experienced operators and users will evaluate it and give their feedback,"" explains Thor Hukkelï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, Principal Engineer Marine Operations, Kongsberg Maritime AS. The project will study how people make decisions during demanding and advanced marine operations, particularly under stress; with the purpose of learning how to build optimal systems for situational 
awareness and operator decision support. The solution is believed to be a combination of changes to control system design processes, information exchange methods, workload sharing and training. The project 
will address all phases""Demanding and critical marine operations like anchor handling, rig moves, heavy lift operations, subsea construction, pipe-laying, and FPSO offloading all push people, vessels and systems to their 
limits,"" continues Hukkelï¿½ï¿""The consequences of making wrong decisions during failure or stress situations can be disastrous so sophisticated, but simple to understand decision support tools developed 
through user-centred design are vital. We believe the research will show that a shift in focus from boxes, systems and equipment to function, information and operation will have tangible effects on safety 
and operational performance."" A major emphasis in the new generation of systems that will be developed as a result of the project is expected to be on functions that use all available information to predict future state, and through 
this, reduce the risk that situations develop in a critical direction. The Prediction Module will be a collection of 'What if' simulation models based on current and forecast weather, vessel systems, 
sensors, motion and stability data and data exchange (position, heading, speed etc) with all other vessels in the operation. The new system will represent something completely new and will be designed 
in collaboration with leading specialist technology firms. ""The research phases of the project will be put to the test in collaboration with all partners, including SimSea AS, a new training facility in Haugesund that has just taken delivery of a highly sophisticated 
and fully integrated Kongsberg Maritime Offshore Vessel Simulator. The project will also benefit from results gained in the SIMAR project, which is being conducted with many of the same partners and is 
focused on human factors in simulation training,"" concludes Hukkelï¿½ï",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2012/new-research-project-set-to-prove-less-is-more-for-offshore-operational/
KONGSBERG develops a unique integrated DP solution,"KONGSBERG develops a unique integrated DP solution Dynamic Positioning and manoeuvring solution to Pieter Schelte - Allseas' platform installation/decommissioning and pipelay vessel - the largest construction vessel ever built, will be delivered in 2011. 26 Mar 2008 Pieter Schelte - Allseas' platform installation/decommissioning and pipelay vessel. Integrated dynamic positioning & manoeuvring solution After the successful launch of Audacia in November 2007, Allseas is now fully committed to its next construction vessel - Pieter Schelte - which will take the pipe laying specialist into new territory by providing heavy lift and platform removal capability. With the Dutch company Imtech Marine & Offshore as contractor for the power and drive solution, Kongsberg Maritime will supply a unique integrated Dynamic Positioning and manoeuvring solution, tailored to the operations of Pieter Schelte. Outstrip the existing global fleet Pieter Schelte will be one of the most advanced construction vessels in operation, and is due to enter service in 2011. With the U-shaped slot at the bow, the vessel can position itself around a platform jacket prior to the removal process. For field abandonment/lifting operations, the vessel will have a capacity to handle topsides of 48,000 metric tons and jackets up to 25,000 metric tons. In pipe laying mode, with a tension capacity of 1,500 (upgradeable to 2,000) metric tons, the vessel will by far outstrip the existing global fleet. The right solution ""The operational capabilities of Pieter Schelte are enormous and thus require state of the art quality control systems. Considering the complex operations that we will be involved in, we put a lot of trust in the integrated Dynamic Positioning and manoeuvring solution,"" says Gerard Stenfert, E&I lead engineer, at Allseas. ""With the past good experience we have with Kongsberg Maritime, we are confident that they will provide us with the right solution."" Complete solution The Kongsberg Maritime integrated Dynamic Positioning and manoeuvring concept relies on a distributed and open system design, which employs a fully backed-up system-wide standardized communication network. The communication network integrates the K-POS Dynamic Positioning, K-Thrust thruster control, and K-Chief machinery automation systems, into a complete solution with unique positioning and manoeuvring capabilities required for e.g. the planned heavy lift operations. Two fully redundant bridges The vessel employs two fully equipped redundant bridges; forward and aft (in separate fire zones). The Kongsberg Maritime supplied equipment communicates either via the redundant LAN network or via the alternative also redundant serial network. The two bridges thus provide full redundancy for each other and the total system is redundant to an extent that surpasses the DP class 3 requirements. ""Built-in blackout prevention features such as dynamic load limitation of propulsion and thrusters drives, monitoring of load sharing devices and load shedding are all features needed to provide a robust Dynamic Positioning and manoeuvring solution to Pieter Schelte,"" comments Birger Evensen, sales manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ""Although every project is different, the sheer scale of Pieter Schelte represented numerous challenges as we developed this complex solution. We had to employ the total sum of our knowledge and experience to create a system capable of positioning and manoeuvring such a massive vessel, and are confident that we have achieved this aim.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/kongsberg-develops-a-unique-integrated-dp-solution/

Egil Haugsdal, President, Kongsberg Maritime, commented: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are delighted to work with Svitzer and ABS on this important collaboration. Kongsberg Maritime is leading the market in maritime autonomy and are involved in several projects that define the remote and autonomous vessel control systems for tomorrow; this venture takes that ground-breaking work a step further by integrating these key technologies into a new context of operation. At Kongsberg, we believe that digitalisation and enhanced automation are vital to ensuring a safe, sustainable and profitable future for the maritime industry, and the  by this project is of great importance in demonstrating the application.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The project is a natural continuation of the first Svitzer/Kongsberg Maritime (formerly Rolls-Royce Marine) project announced in 2017 centred around remotely operated navigation of the Svitzer Hermod tug in the Port of Copenhagen. As a result of the project, the partners safely conducted a number of remotely controlled, non-towage specific manoeuvres on water. From the quay side in Copenhagen harbour the vessel master, stationed at a remote operating centre, berthed the vessel alongside the quay, undocked, turned 360ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, went for a sail and safely docked again. The near-shore environment of harbour towage, where Svitzer operates, is well-suited for remote controlling which requires full connectivity and Svitzer is excited to be partnering up with Kongsberg Maritime and ABS. Ingrid Uppelschoten Snelderwaard, Svitzerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s global COO, commented: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Whiard in commercial operation, there is no doubt that advanced autonomy is progressing fast across the maritime industry. At Svitzer, we are determined to be at the forefront of the innovation in this space to ensure we are well positioned to meet changing demands. We start with one tug and explore from there how to best leverage technology, improve safety and efficiency and meet our customerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s demand for reliable & cost-efficient services, also in the future. Technology is changing our lives across the board and at Svitzer we want to influence and drive how technology will transform towage over time. Safety comes first, and this entire project is first and foremost relying on the implied safety case.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Christopher Wi""As a data-centric organization, ABS is a leader in the maritime application of digital technologies. As safety moves away from the things you can see and touch, to things you cannot see such as software and data, ABS has been spearheading development of next generation safety approaches that draw on our expertise as a technical integrator. As a result of this tradition of constant innovation, we are uniquely well placed to support this project, which is genuinely breaking new ground for the entire industry. Greater industry collaboration is going to be key to meeting the challenges of digitalization and maritime sustainability, so ABS is proud to be part of a team that has such a significant role to play in shaping the direction of both.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For further information, please contact: Gunvor Hatling Midtbï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vice President, ",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2021/kongsberg-maritime-and-abs-join-forces/
NOAA Plume Discovery with KONGSBERG Multibeam Echosounder,"NOAA Plume Discovery with KONGSBERG Multibeam Echosounder 07 Oct 2009 Okeanos Explorer travels around the globe to map the seafloor and characterize largely unknown areas of the ocean. EM 302 Image of the Amphitheater-Shaped plume basin. EM 302 Image of Plumes using IVS3D Fledermaus. Fledermaus Standard is a powerful interactive 3D data visualization system. On its first voyage using the KONGSBERG Multibeam Echosounder EM 302, the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer made a major discovery of what are believed to be methane gas plumes. EM 302 water column data detected the plumes while transiting to the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary working grounds from Astoria, Oregon. The plumes were located in water depths between 1200 and 1900 meters. All plumes were observed to rise to a water depth between 500-550 meters making their heights between 700-1400 meters. In a journal article about the findings, Dr. Gardner and Mashoor Malik (CCOM/JHC) report that although seafloor sediments in shallow areas closer to the coast are known to harbour methane, no one has reported such plumes in waters this deep. A potent greenhouse gas The discovery of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is very significant for marine life. Scientists fear that as the world's oceans warm, huge amounts of methane will be released. This will increases the acidity of the ocean, and can inhibit the ability of marine creatures to grow shells. Dr. Jim Gardner and Mashoor Malik (CCOM/JHC) suggest that the plumes are made up of a stream of methane bubbles coated with methane-rich ice which will melt as a result of warmer waters. ""The ice coating, a material called methane hydrate, is stable in deep water, where pressure is high and the water is cold. When the ice-cloaked bubbles ascend into warmer waters near the surface, the ice melts and the methane dissolves into the sea"", they report. High resolution maps Okeanos Explorer is the only United States ship assigned to exploring systematically our largely unknown ocean. It is fitted with a hull-mounted, first of its kind, KONGSBERG EM 302, which will provide explorers with high-resolution maps of the seafloor from 40 to 4000 meters. Maps from the system will be used to identify unique seafloor features for further exploration, and will be integrated into the high-precision DVL-Nav navigation system to provide a road map for exploring a particular site with the ROV.

Kongsberg Maritime launches innovative new solution for 3D subsea monitoring of wind turbines and underwater structures,"Kongsberg Maritime launches innovative new solution for 3D subsea monitoring of wind turbines and underwater structures 23 Sep 2014 Kongsberg Maritime, a leading maritime, offshore and subsea technology developer has launched a unique solution for the detection of Scouring, Corrosion, Deformation and Marine Growth, which can destabilise 
wind turbines and underwater structures causing expensive, and potentially environmentally hazardous damage. On show at WindEnergy Hamburg 2014, the new K-Observer system, which is part of Kongsberg Maritime's Modular Subsea Monitoring Network (MSM), provides accurate, remote hydroacoustic 3D monitoring using 
the Dual Axis Scanning Sonar (DAS) to continuously monitor the seabed and the substructure. The 3D point cloud data created by the DAS is logged and transmitted to shore via the telemetry infrastructure of the K-Observer System (cabled, wireless or satellite) installed on the turbine. The 
system is designed for long-term installations and performs fully autonomously, from sensor control, data acquisition, to data processing, presentation of results and issuing of alarms (e.g. by text message 
or email). K-Observer accurately scans and interprets the condition of the seabed around the base of the structure (scouring and sediment displacement), as well as the state of the substructure itself (deformation, 
marine growth and corrosion) so experts on shore can initiate immediate action or preventative maintenance if required. This is a comparably low cost, safe and time efficient method of monitoring and 
detection compared to i.e. diver surveys. K-Observer is a highly advanced system that not only monitors and observes the depth of the seabed around each wind turbine or subsea structure (scour and sediment displacement), which is important 
information in itself, but also provides insight regarding the current state of the substructure itself (deformation, marine growth and corrosion). This translates into lower intervention costs for maintaining 
the structure within the design parameters and avoids reductions in the life span of the wind turbine associated with unstable foundations and vibration induced structural fatigue.K-Observer is a 
module of the Modular Subsea Monitoring Network system launched by Kongsberg Maritime at Oceanology International 2014 in March. Advanced data processing and power management strategies ensure the MSM's ability to deliver critical sensor data continuously, for long duration missions. The modularity and scalability of the MSM 
allows for easy deployment and adaptation to different monitoring tasks, ranging from very early leak detection and condition monitoring around subsea structures to environmental monitoring on the seabed 
and in the water column. The MSM was developed in co-operation with the Kongsberg Maritime owned, Germany based company, Kongsberg Maritime Embient. Over the last years Embient has developed a strong in-house competence within 
underwater inspection and monitoring, as well as on subsea leak detection",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/kongsberg-maritime-launches-innovative-new-solution-for-3d-subsea-monitoring-of/
"Kongsberg Maritime unveils new, integrated waterjet control systems for optimal craft operability","Kongsberg Maritime unveils new, integrated waterjet control systems for optimal craft operability KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s JCS Compact and JCS Extended systems offer optimal waterjet control for a wide range of craft. 03 Jun 2021 Kongsberg Maritime is pleased to announce the launch of two innovative waterjet control systems based on its new JCS ( Jet Control System ) common technology platform: JCS Compact and JCS Extended . The use of standardised components across both systems keeps costs down and enhances operational simplicity. JCS Compact is a tailored, closed-loop control system solution designed to manage the steering, reversing bucket and optional interceptor functions on small- to medium-sized waterjets. It can be used with either one or two control stations and a single waterjet propulsion unit or, for full redundancy and operational safety in the event of unforeseen issues, a dual-waterjet configuration. Each JCS Compact, complete with waterjet unit and hydraulic components, is factoryed before delivery. Its modest dimensions, plug-in assembly and easy-to-follow system start-up instructions make installation and commissioning simple. In use, the system works together with the waterjet propulsors to provide accurate, smooth and reliable control. A high-contrast 2.8ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ display panel provides a visual representation of the steering angle and reversing bucket position and shows informational parameters and alarms, with a variable brightness control to ensure optimal visibility in both direct sunlight and night-time operations. JCS Extended applies the same seamless functionality but on a larger, more advanced scale. Just like its smaller sibling, JCS Extended is used to control waterjet steering, reversing bucket and optional interceptor functions, but can accommodate up to three control stations and four waterjet propulsion units. Similar to the JCS Compact, the integrated feedback signals provide maximum accuracy in operating the waterjet hydraulic valves. In additionlows for an optional GNSS antenna. JCS Extended also offers a variety of advanced, built-in optional functions for optimal operational smoothness and stability. Auto Positioning, Anchor Point, Auto Heading and Trim Assist provide optimal craft operability and can lead to lower operational costs in terms of fuel savings. Park Mode enables hydraulic cylinder rods to be withdrawn to prevent fouling when vessels are docked in areas with a high concentration of bio-organisms. Each control station used with the JCS Extended solution will have its own high-contrast 7ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ display, with dedicated views providing detailed information for each specific function. On the bridge, design factors such as joystick and armrest integration have been ergonomically updated, while an optional secure remote access solution provides users with high-level KONGSBERG servicing support and enhanced alarm traceability. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½These sophisticated but tough new waterjet control systems are construce even in the most extreme conditions,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Gunder Norrbygï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rd, Technical Product Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Flexibility is also key, with advanced optional functionalities and the ability for customers to adapt the systems to fulfil their requirements. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For further information, please contact: Gunvor Hatling Midtbï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vice President, Communications +47 99 21 42 09",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2021/kongsberg-maritime-unveils-new-integrated-waterjet-control-systems-for-optimal-craft-operability/

The Kongsberg Maritime EM2040 multibeam echosounder goes compact,"The Kongsberg Maritime EM2040 multibeam echosounder goes compact High resolution, cost effective shallow-water surveys now possible on small boats 04 Apr 2013 Kongsberg Maritime will introduce the new EM 2040 Compact, a sophisticated multibeam echo sounder for high resolution mapping and inspection applications, during Ocean Business 2013. Based on the state-of-the-art EM 2040 multibeam, the EM 2040C is a significant development in acoustic technology that makes highly detailed surveys of shallow water possible using small boats and launches. Kongsberg Maritime will also offer another variant, the EM2040CX for use on AUVs, ROVs and other vessels of opportunity. Available in single or dual head configurations, the EM 2040C is the natural successor to Kongsberg Maritime's established compact multibeam, the EM 3002. Because the EM 2040C is based on the most sophisticated shallow water multibeam technology platform available today, it offers significantly improved performance over the EM 3002, whilst still being suitable for use aboard small vessels. The EM 2040C ensures that highly accurate data is available in real-time. This makes it possible to conduct very cost-effective surveys with lower requirements for post-processing, due to the high quality of data available. Application possibilities include port and harbour surveys, post-dredging surveys, shipwreck exploration, habitat mapping, pipeline inspection and hydrographic surveys to a standard that exceeds IHO S44 and LINZ performance requirements. The EM 2040C features high resolution and a wide frequency range from 200 to 400 kHz, with frequency selection in steps of 10 kHz. It uses Frequency Modulated (FM) chirp to extend range and offers a maximum depth of 490m with a beam width of 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at 400 kHz. In dual configuration, with two Sonar Heads tilted to each side, 200ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ total coverage can be achieved, which enables surveying to the water surface""The EM 2040 Compact introduces a wealth of new possibilities by providing the same levels of clean & accurate data as the highly acclaimed EM 2040 multibeam whilst being similar in size to our older compact multibeam, the EM 3002,"" comments Helge Uhlen, Product Sales Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ""This means that highly detailed data, which requires no, or very little post processing, can be available for a much wider range of survey applications."" KONGSBERG multibeam systems are recognised for high sounding accuracy, dense pattern of soundings to cover the seafloor, excellent build quality and robustness. In addition to the soundings, all KONGSBERG multibeam echo sounders produce water column data and seabed image data similar to a side scan sonar image. The water column data is useful to detect the shallowest depth or for displaying objects and features in the water column such as seeps and tops of masts, etc. The seabed image is useful for characterising the seabed and can detect features not visible in the sounding data. Kongsberg Maritime has created a straightforward upgrade path from the EM 3002 compact multibeam to the new EM 2040C. For a limited time, EM 3002 owners will also be offered a discount on exchange of EM 3002 components when upgrading to EM 2040C.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2013/the-kongsberg-maritime-em2040-multibeam-echosounder-goes-compact/
Reshaping Underwater Operations ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Live Footage of Groundbreaking Robotic,"Reshaping Underwater Operations ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Live Footage of Groundbreaking Robotic Subsea 'Snake' Released Eelume AS has released the first live video footage of its game changing take on underwater intervention vehicles. With the support of Kongsberg Maritime as a development partner, the unique new Eelume 
robot has torn up the marine robotics rulebook to create a futuristic, snake-like vehicle designed to live permanently underwater and carry out underwater intervention tasks that would normally require 
the mobilisation of expensive surface vehicles for divers or to launch and retrieve ROVs or AUVs. 17 Feb 2017 The footage captured at the PREZIOSO Linjebygg Subsea Test Center during trials in the Trondheimsfjord shows the potential of the Eelume vehicle to significantly improve inspection and light intervention operations on subsea installations. The modular, snake-like design allows the Eelume vehicle to access hard to reach points on subsea structures while its ability to shift into a U-ation allows intricate interactions using a diverse toolset including torque tools, grippers and specialised maintenance equipment. The trials verified and demonstrated the features of Eelume's snake-like underwater robot in a deep-water, marine environment. Eelume confirmed that its vehicle has superior manoeuvrability, in a stable sensor and actuator platform, and can provide easy access to constrained areas not accessible by conventional underwater vehicles. The Eelume solution will dramatically save costs by reducing the use of expensive surface vessels. The solution can be installed on both existing and new fields where typical jobs include; visual inspection, cleaning, and operating valves and chokes. These jobs account for a large part of the total subsea inspection and intervention spend. ""Supported by Kongsberg Maritime's Marine Robotics department, Eelume's recent demonstration was the culmination of the last year of development work on this exciting project,"" said Richard Mills, Director of Sales Marine Robotics, Kongsberg Maritime. ""We have learnt a huge amount during the development phase of the Eelume vehicle, not least the need to configure the system architecture correctly to enable future developments. When completed, the vehicle will operate with a wide range of tools and sensors including KONGSBERG positioning, communications and potentially acoustic inspection sensors and chemical sniffers."" ""Everything is progressing on schedule for the intervention demonstration during the latter part of 2018. The system has proven itself to be a very capable inspection tool able to reach confined areas with ease. Potential operators and end customers have shown a lot of interest in Eelume, not just because it is an interesting technology, but also because it can do things that no other vehicle can,"" concludes Arne Kjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rsvik, CEO, Eelume.

""It took one week, from the beginning of the transportation in Horten to the HUGIN 1000 first touched Korean waters, which is quite fantastic"", explains &M HUGIN AUVs, Svein Otto Schjerven. ""The first operation of this kind with the HUGIN 1000 system 
was a great success, and fully demonstrated the capacity of such an AUV system."" HUGIN 1000 Portable AUV System The portable AUV system is fully containerized into one 20-foot ISO container for storage, battery management, vehicle maintenance, launch and recovery (L&R), and one 10-foot ISO container for mission planning, vehicle checkout, mission execution, 
and post-mission analysis (PMA). This advanced AUV system covers a wide range of operations like MCM, REA, route survey and high-quality bathymetric mapping surveys in areas of interest. The main advantage of the HUGIN AUV is its small overall system footprint. This is primarily due to the multi-function 20-foot container, providing AUV storage, shipping, maintenance, battery charging, launch and recovery facilities, and furthermore 
due to the compactness of the 10-foot operations container, with only two operators needed for the entire operation. The system allows fast and easy mobilization onto vessels of opportunity due to ISO containerization, well-defined and simple interface points, and the self-sufficient nature of the system. The entire system fits on a standard truck, and can use all 
standard shipping methods, including overnight airlift to anywhere in the world. AUV operations are run directly from the 10-foot ISO container, with no need to tie into a ship's systems or internal spaces. In the portable system, a KONGSBERG High-Precision Acoustic Positioning (HiPAP) 350 system and a tow-fish transducer for 
acoustic communication are included, as well as a Kongsberg SeaPath system for accurate ship reference position and attitude. The 20-foot container includes a two-stage L&R ""stinger"" (hydraulically controlled hinged ramp) which allows AUV operations from vessels with a stern freeboard of up to 5 meters. Both ISO containers are insulated and equipped with heating systems 
to enable operations in Arctic environments, as well as air condition system for operations in tropical climate.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/hugin-1000-portable-auv-system-demonstrated-in-korea/

Portuguese Survey company gets to grips with latest generation GeoSwath Plus survey software,"Portuguese Survey company gets to grips with latest generation GeoSwath Plus survey software Released to selected trial customers earlier this year, the next generation software for Kongsberg Maritime's GeoSwath Plus shallow water multibeam echo sounder has already been put through its paces 
on the river Douro in Northern Portugal by one of the country's leading survey companies, Lagoa do Ruivo Survey (LRS). The new GS4 all-in-one survey package is a completely re-worked version of the GS+ 
software, providing higher performance and a contemporary look and feel. The software is now available to all GeoSwath Plus users. 18 Jun 2015 Sand ripples on the bar entrance to Setubal harbor imaged with the GeoSwath Plus multibeam and the new GS4 survey software. The user-friendly GS4 all-in-one survey package has been a significant asset for LRS's latest projects. Recent surveys using the software include high resolution bathymetry used for planning a route 
for a cable from an offshore windfarm; the search for containers lost at sea during a storm; monitoring craterisation of the seabed surrounding an inlet pipeline for a fish farm; monitoring of sand dunes; 
evaluation of dredged volumes in a major port, and evaluation of the silting up of the main doors of a large dry dock. LRS has been a GeoSwath user since 2002, when it first deployed the GeoSwath 32 250Khz bathymetry system to survey 200km of the river Douro. The company had been testing various multibeam systems but 
chose GeoSwath Plus for its quality of the data, affordability, compatibility, and the considerable coverage it provides in shallow water. Today LRS uses the advanced GeoSwath Plus multibeam system from Kongsberg Maritime, and considering its long term use of the technology, it was an ideal candidate for early use of the new GS4 solution. 
LRS has tested a beta version of GS4 for six months and was among the first customers to enjoy new features in all stages of their workflow, from line planning and acquisition through to post-processing. 
Other GS4 functionality includes calibration, and DTM and side scan mosaic production and visualisation.

The Full Picture Goes Green,"The Full Picture Goes Green 23 Sep 2008 Kongsberg Maritime presents new Green Ship strategy at SMM 2008 Torfinn Kildal, President Kongsberg Maritime. With the power to monitor, control and improve environmental performance whilst 
reducing operational costs, Kongsberg Maritime's integrated ship systems are giving 
shipowners the tools to go green. Going green is a major focus within the shipping 
industry right now, so there's no better place than SMM 2008 to present this new 
Green Ship strategy to the maritime world. Improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions Kongsberg Maritime, as a supplier of integrated ship systems, can play a crucial 
role in the optimal operation of ships, improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. 
To reach this goal, the company is dedicated to developing new systems and is involved 
with several projects and trials implemented to further reduce the environmental 
impact of shipping whilst providing added value and cost-effectiveness. ""In line with our environmental policy, we are developing a concept for optimal 
vessel performance that takes into account both machinery onboard the ship as well 
as the way the vessel is navigated, to ensure less consumption of fuel and lower 
emissions,"" says Torfinn Kildal, President, Kongsberg Maritime. ""A traditional way 
to monitor ship performance is by adjusting the ship optimally on its first test 
run, when the hull is clean and the machinery is new and well-tuned. This performance 
becomes a yardstick to measure how the ship performs at its best. If the ship moves 
too far away from this standard, you know that something is wrong. We want to bring 
this some steps forward by more sophisticated instrumentation, monitoring, operator 
guidance and automatic control where feasible"" Shared environmental gains The Kongsberg Maritime approach to vessel performance combines a holistic perspective, 
in line with its integrated 'Full Picture' systems, with specific areas for improvement, 
including hull diagnostics and performance, engine diagnostics and performance, 
power performance, cargo/ballast management, route planning and speed profile optimisation. 
Each of these parts contributes to a complete vessel performance picture, which 
forms the basis for meaningful adjustments by officers and operators. Kongsberg 
Maritime is working closely with customers, partners, suppliers and the industry 
at large to develop and test solutions that contribute to shared environmental gains. ""We are looking for the most environmentally-friendly solutions possible in the

Commenting on the recent contract award Dr. Al Plueddemann stated that ""Many important processes take place beneath the Arctic ice cover in winter and are very difficult to observe using traditional shipboard sampling techniques. Small AUVs hold great promise for under-ice exploration, but communication and navigation are difficult because the vehicle cannot surface to get a GPS fix, or use satellite or radio communications to report status or receive new commands."" Lee Freitag, a senior engineer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution - WHOI involved in the project, continued, saying ""this new under-ice REMUS vehicle is being modified to use lower frequency acoustic communication and navigation signals for longer range because low frequency sounds travel further in the ocean. Longer range allows sampling larger areas without having to recover the vehicle through a hole in the ice and repositioning it and the communications and navigation beacons. The estimated range of the new system is on the order of 10 kilometers, which allows a survey area up to 300 square kilometers. WHOI presently has several REMUS systems in various departments of the Institution involved in a range of oceanographic projects. The technology continues to be advanced by the Oceanographic Systems Laboratory at WHOI and others within the WHOI Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Department, and by Hydroid Inc. Kevin McCarthy, Vice President of Marketing at Hydroid commented that ""Hydroid continues to work very closely with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as the capabilities of the REMUS technology advance and are more widely accepted in the scientific community.

Kongsberg Maritime delivers training on Hugin AUV systems,"Kongsberg Maritime delivers training on Hugin AUV systems Indonesian Navy's new survey ship program includes two Hugin AUV systems. Kongsberg Maritime's Marine Robotics department provided three weeks of training in Jakarta. The introduction 
training was conducted at a hotel in Central Jakarta, and the last week was at sea in Semangka Bay for extensive practical training down to depths of 1000 m. 29 Apr 2016 The training objectives for the crew before embarking for the sea trials were numerous, ranging from thorough system understanding to inertial navigation and advanced mission planning. ""Language barriers 
made the training challenging"", says chief AUV instructor Stian Hopmark, ""luckily, this was compensated for by the students having an extraordinary interest in the subjects and willingness to learn"". 
Hopmark says a variety of training methods were required to overcome cultural barriers, but he was confident that they would overcome. ""Acquiring the world's most advanced AUV is a matter of national 
pride, and the students proved they were up for the task"". Discussions on optimal mission planning was a central part of the training. Photos courtesy Indonesian Navy. Implementing a new system, which requires tight cooperation between the ops-room, bridge personnel and aft-deck operators is demanding, even for a disciplined organisation like the Indonesian Navy. 
Hence, the training also provided the crews with valuable experience and a basis for developing their own procedures and concept of operations. OCEA SA, the French shipbuilder that built and delivered the two survey ships has stated that they are very pleased with Kongsberg Maritime's efforts during the training. ""Both crews have gained a 
lot of experience and feedback on their AUV HUGIN system, in a very high level of expertise provided by the Kongsberg Team. Goals of operator training have been reached above expectations,"" says Mr Julien 
Lagadec, OCEAs representative in Jakarta. The Head of Delegate from the Indonesian Navy, Colonel Budi, states that he looks forward to a close cooperation between the Navy and Kongsberg Maritime to further develop the skills and knowledge 
gained during the training. ""We are in many ways pioneers using such advanced survey equipment in South Asia. This is just the start"", colonel Budi says.

GeoSwath Plus shallow water multibeam echosounder implementation on inland waterways,"GeoSwath Plus shallow water multibeam echosounder implementation on inland waterways 17 Jun 2013 The pusher-tug Strekov was converted to a survey vessel. Bathymetry data showing the detected object on the riverbed partly buried. The bathymetry data has been the basis for wreck recovery. Small boat found in the harbour. VARS BRNO a.s. from the Czech Republic recently carried out surveys in cooperation with state enterprise Povodï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Labe on the River Elbe, or the River Labe as it is called in the Czech language. The 
main aim of the project was to provide data for vessel skippers to assist with navigation planning and vessel loading decisions based upon actual depths. VARS use their 250 kHz version of the GeoSwath Plus combined multibeam echosounder and side scan sonar system to provide them with superior high resolution depth data over a wide angle of coverage in the shallow 
waters encountered in this challenging location. Initial surveys were carried out on a stretch of the River Elbe between r and the Czech city of Ustï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. This 42 km stretch is extremely shallow with depths ranging from 1 to 6 metres 
where the water level varies depending upon flow rate, and local rainfall. In this part of the river secure navigation depths are constantly changing, often during the course of a single day, based on 
the volume of rain encountered. Furthermore the navigable channel is often not wider than 40 metres, which results in very high currents. In this area accidents happen frequently, often caused by 
groundings. Results of the surveys serve primarily to generate depth data for safe navigation and object detection. The data is imported as the default depth reading to the inland electronic navigational 
charts (IENC). The measurements are also used to identify areas for dredging and to target anomalous soundings for further investigation. Detailed digital terrain models of the river bottom have recently uncovered some hidden secrets. A number of objects, possibly hazardous to navigation and ously, have been removed 
from the channel. The data here shows the bathymetric image of a small vessel which was subsequently pulled from the river.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2013/geoswath-plus-shallow-water-multibeam-echosounder-implementation-on-inland/

Unique onboard training system wins prestigious dynamic positioning award,"Unique onboard training system wins prestigious dynamic positioning award The ground-breaking ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Onboard Training System' (OTS), developed by recently acquired Kongsberg Maritime company SMSC, won the prestigious Dynamic Positioning Award at the Offshore Support 
Journal Conference, Awards & Exhibition in London last week. The sophisticated system, which allows users to control a real vessel under DP, but within a simulated environment, was recognised by the award 
judges as a completely unique and positive new approach to Dynamic Positioning Operator (DPO) training. 08 Feb 2016 With the OTS concept, the vessel is controlled in a normal manner by a deck officer on the bridge, either by the use of manual controls or by the use of Dynamic Positioning (DP). The vessel's motion 
and position in the virtual world is calculated based on input from the vessel's navigational aids (minimum GPS and Gyro) and shown on a dedicated screen. While the vessel is actually in safe, open waters, 
the virmaginary objects and installations (such as rigs, buoys, piers, etc.) shown on the screen. Using this setup, the DP operator can simulate approach to a platform or other 
installations, docking the ship at any port, navigating in narrow and constricted waters, and various other operations. During training, the real DP system is live, so the vessel physically moves according to input, but the operator sees the results in the simulated visual scene. In this way, instructors can introduce 
any conditions or combination of targets, allowing them to create exercises that deliver real-life experience, with the flexibility to train on specific operations or areas of competence. The concept, 
which is already in use on several vessels, enables DPOs to understand how a vessel really responds to their commands, whilst interacting with virtual objects in a simulated environment, with the flexibility 
to introduce any tasks or conditions. From the Offshore Support Journal Award ceremony. From left: Graham Harman, Operations Director Riviera Maritime Media -

Kongsberg Maritime unveils new cost-effective tunnel thrusters for merchant sector,"Kongsberg Maritime unveils new cost-effective tunnel thrusters for merchant sector Kongsberg Maritime has unveiled a new series of tunnel thrusters designed to meet demand from the merchant marine sector for a system that is less complex to install, easier to maintain, and more cost-effective to operate than existing thrusters of comparable size. 06 Jun 2019 Drawing on more than 40 years of tunnel thruster experience and the results of a development project led by a Kongsberg Maritime team at the companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s propulsion facility in Ulsteinvik, Norway, the new Tunnel Thruster Commercial (TTC) is particularly suitable for cruise ships, ferries, ro-ro vessels and containerships. Available in two basic sizes, covering four propeller diameters and power outputs ranging from 1000kW to 5000kW, the mechanical thruster is a modular system based on standard components, not only to reduce installation and commissioning time by between 20% to 30%, but also CAPEX and OPEX. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½tister development on the offshore vessel market. This sector typically requires a robust thruster with high performance and dynamic positioning capability. However, these thrusters are high-end, high-value products that do not correspond well with merchant market requirements.

With the new TTC thruster, we have achieved a more cost-effective solution for newbuild and retrofit application to existing commercial ships. Since commercial ships rarely require DP functionality and only operate their thrusters for a limited period, we have been able to standardise the system, reduce components and optimise installation.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rd Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rlï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½w VP Global Sales and Marketing The TTC has been specifically developed to replace thrusters of comparable size, in a vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s existing standard tunnel without the need for fabrication, welding or steelwork. The new thruster is fully interchangeable with the current tunnel thruster ranges can be changed with access from the tunnel side and there is no need to remove the thrusterï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s intermediate shaft and drive motor during overhaul work. By standardising and reducing the number of components, the TTC incorporates the same Kongsberg Maritime roller bearing and gear technologies used across the tunnel thruster range, but these have been adapted for use with Environmentally Acceptable Lubricants (EAL) to reduce operational impact on the marine environment. Full-scale trials have been proven successful with the TTC running for more than 1500 hours. The TTC is designed for intermittent operation.

KONGSBERG introduces long range battery powered RADius transponder,"KONGSBERG introduces long range battery powered RADius transponder 12 Jun 2007 The RADius 700 is a battery powered transponder that offers proven signal acquisition up 1000 meters. The RADius system measures distance and bearing between a moving vessel equipped 
with RADius sensor heads and retro-reflective transponders mounted on the target 
that the vessel is approaching. Multiple RADius sensor heads onboard increase the 
angle at which the transponder signal can be received, which allows further flexibility 
to navigate on approach to the transponder equipped target. This in turn provides 
more freedom and safer manoeuvring. RADius 700 The RADius 700 is a battery powered transponder that offers proven signal acquisition 
up 1000 meters for a vessel equipped with RADius interrogators. As the RADius 700 
transponder operates on internal batteries, it's very easy to deploy as no cable 
connection is necessary. The replaceable internal Lithium battery has an estimated 
life time of two years. All RADius transponders are coded with unique IDs ensuring reliable identification 
and tracking in cluttered environments. Several interrogators can approach the same 
transponders, ensuring multi-user capabilities. Up to five transponders can be tracked 
simultaneously by the interrogator. Kongsberg Seatex is also releasing a new RADius transponder aimed at the seismic

The bridge of the motor yacht Northern Star. Click to view larger image. Exteriour view of the motor yacht. Click to view larger image. The Northern Star, a stunning 75m motor yacht built by Lurssen shipping in Germany has received an extensive bridge navigation and manoeuvring solution from Kongsberg Maritime. The systems were specified by the vessel's owner based on Kongsberg 
Maritime's position as a leading supplier of similar systems to the offshore market. North-West passage With Kongsberg Maritime's proven systems onboard and a hull-mounted iron reinforcement for ice-breaking, the Arctic expeditions that the Northern Star owner has planned, including the re-tracing of Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen's route 
traversing the North-West passage off the coast of Canada, have been made possible. Far ahead of the competition ""The owner of the Northern Star has a good understanding of ships, and has been personally involved in the whole decision making process,"" says Captain of the Northern Star, Craig Franks. ""He wanted to use the offshore market as a reference when 
choosing systems for the Northern Star, and recommended us to look at equipment from Kongsberg Maritime. We did some research in the market and found that Kongsberg Maritime was far ahead of the competition with its solutions."" Rigorous operation in the harshest environments The Northern Star owner's special interest in adventure travel, means that she has been designed to sail anywhere in the world. Because of this, special features have been implemented, such as a large fuel range and extra insulation for extreme 
climates and cold water, in addition to the Kongsberg Maritime systems that have been tried and tested aboard hundreds of offshore oil & gas vessels, proving their ability to withstand rigorous operation in the harshest environments. Kongsberg Maritime was chosen to deliver systems for navigation, Dynamic Positioning and thrusters control aboard Northern Star. Within this, the scope-of-supply included: K-Bridge MULTI, a multi functional operator station for the bridge; 
K-Bridge conning display for efficient monitoring of all key information; K-Bridge operator and planning stations; steering functions; radio/GMDSS; cJoy operator terminal; K-Thrust thruster control system; bow thruster and pump jet. Re-designed to fit within available space Although all of the Kongsberg Maritime systems installed aboard Northern Star are fit for operation of large offshore vessels that depend on reliable equipment for all conditions and climates, they had to be custom designed to ensure that the high 
aesthetic values of the interior design were upheld. The form factor of the systems was re-designed and novel solutions were needed to make the most of the space available. ""Combined with the emphasis on aesthetics, the lack of space aboard Northern Star was a challenge. We solved this partly by placing electronics in panels above the ceiling, and by redesigning our cabinets just for this installation,"" explains 
Roger Trinterud, Sales Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ""There are not many yachts of this type built every year, but about half of them have Kongsberg Maritime equipment onboard. The fact that our systems are built for the toughest commercial operation 
and that we are able to tailor them to the size and aesthetics of luxury vessels is a large factor in our strong performance in this marketplace.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/motor-yacht-looks-to-the-offshore-industry-for-navigation-and-manoeuvering/

KONGSBERG connects seismic vessels,"KONGSBERG connects seismic vessels 28 Oct 2014 A cutting-edge communication solution developed by Kongsberg Seatex for the marine seismic sector is set to be a highlight at SEG Denver 2014 (the Society of Exploration Geophysicists Annual Meeting) 
on 26-31 October (Booth #2414). The KONGSBERG MBR system enables high speed, high capacity and extremely robust data, voice and video transfer between multiple vessels and other assets. The KONGSBERG 
MBR is set to revolutionise inter-vessel communication in the seismic industry, where the capability to quickly and reliably transfer data is a significant operational advantage. The MBR system is a maritime radio network distribution system operating in the 5GHz band and has demonstrated stable, high capacity communication in a maritime environment, handling close by vessel 
operations, platform obstructions and distances in excess of 50km. Operating as a maritime 'Information Highway', MBR connects crews and their vessels with a high-speed and high capacity digital communication 
channel with 'Fast Track' priority options. Optimised to securely carry a diverse array of operational information (from real-time video streams to system data), MBR allows remotely situated teams to 
work together seamlessly, co-ordinating systems and activities for optimal performance, safety and operational success. A seismic vessel needs to communicate with its workboat for safety and operational reasons and MBR will provide a link to HD video cameras and other sources for everyday use. Large wide- and multi-azimuth 
operations will also benefit from the robust broadband communication channel. Unlike satellite, Wi-Fi, or mobile network platforms, MBR requires no extra infrastructure or equipment beyond the units on 
participating vessels/assets. This makes it a simple to use and maintain solution for enhancing overall project efficiency in seismic operations. ""All Marine Seismic Operations are in reality multi vessel operations and require reliable communication. MBR represents a quantum leap in reliability for this type of communication and we believe 
that users will experience a whole new performance level enabling them to benefit from safer and more efficient operations,"" said Gard Ueland, President of Kongsberg Seatex. ""KONGSBERG is continuously 
developing its core technologies and the highly sophisticated MBR technology is an excellent example of this innovation process.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/kongsberg-connects-seismic-vessels/

Close collaboration between KONGSBERG and Royal Caribbean ensures plain sailing in 2010 for Oasis Of The Seas,"Close collaboration between KONGSBERG and Royal Caribbean ensures plain sailing in 2010 for Oasis Of The Seas 25 Jan 2010 Cruise Control from Kongsberg Maritime aboard world's largest cruise vessel. Royal Caribbean International's groundbreaking mega cruise vessel - Oasis of the Seas. Royal Caribbean International's (RCI) groundbreaking mega cruise vessel - Oasis of the Seas - enters 2010 with critical navigation, maneuvering and automation functions under the proven and trusted command of Kongsberg Maritime control systems. The extensive design and installation project, which is a realisation of Kongsberg Maritime's The Full Picture ethos was undertaken in close collaboration with RCI at the STX yard in Turku, Finland. Complete Cruise Control Complete Cruise Control is the driving concept behind the Kongsberg Maritime installation aboard the world's largest cruise vessel, which at its heart features a complex bridge control system. With six Wartsila diesel electric engines delivering close to 100MW of power to four large 5MW bow thrusters and three 20MW podded azimuth propulsion systems supplied by ABB Marine, Oasis has a unique and powerful propulsion system. The challenge of controlling all of that power from the bridge, in order to safely and efficiently move the 65 meters tall, 360 meters long, 47 meters wide, 225,282 GRT Oasis fell to Kongsberg Maritime, when it was contracted to supply the propulsion control system and dynamic positioning (DP2), in addition to power management, machinery automation and HVAC automation systems. With such a complex scope of supply, it was vital that Kongsberg Maritime's designers and engineers worked closely with RCI, throughout every stage of the project. ""Over the past decade, shipyards have embraced an outsourcing production model. In addition, the increased size and complexity of the vessels we build demands close cooperation, so we tend to work with companies such as Kongsberg Maritime who share our values and business culture,"" said Anders Aasen, RCI's Associate Vice President, Marine Technical Services. The right bridge control system Captain Bill Wright, Senior Vice President of RCI, and Captain of Oasis of the Seas believes that many different components came together to make the system meet RCI's requirements for such a large vessel: ""Oasis has about 15,000 square meters of sail area, so manoeuvring the vessel in and out of small or busy ports in challenging wind and sea conditions requires a powerful and dynamic propulsion control system. We worked closely with Kongsberg Maritime to ensure we got the right bridge control system and functionalities in the software solution to match our needs."" Captain Wright's influence also extended to fine tuning the KONGSBERG DP system by suggesting some software refinements to ensure the redundant DP system was optimised for the Oasis. ""There were some functions we didn't need and others we wanted, and with KONGSBERG's help, we ended up with a system which meets our requirements. In fact, there are elements to the DP system aboard the Oasis which I am confident would be of interest to the offshore industry."" More simultaneous information According to Rolf Taxt, Kongsberg Maritime's Project Manager (Integrated Control Systems), the company places a high value on the input delivered by RCI personnel. ""Oasis is among the largest, most challenging projects we've ever worked on, and it is a credit to RCI's personnel and the yard that everything has gone smoothly. In addition to customising the DP software and bridge control systems, RCI wanted wide-screen monitors, which allows us to make available more information on screen for bridge officers. Following this, we are now able to offer the same widescreen solution to other customers."" The collaboration between Kongsberg Maritime and RCI continues apace as Oasis of the Seas enters 2010; with the installation of a similar Cruise Control system aboard her sister ship, Allure of the Seas, which is due to sail in November 2010 after completion at the STX yard in Turku.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/close-collaboration-between-kongsberg-and-royal-caribbean-ensures-plain-sailing/

New shallow-medium depth Multibeam Echo Sounder delivers unmatched range and resolution performance,"New shallow-medium depth Multibeam Echo Sounder delivers unmatched range and resolution performance Kongsberg Maritime has introduced a new multibeam echo sounder designed for survey and inspection operations in shallow and medium water depths. The new KONGSBERG EM 712 multibeam echo sounder is 
the second generation of wideband multibeam for these water depths. Delivering highly accurate results through superior range and resolution to all relevant survey standards, the EM 712 supersedes the 
EM 710, which is well established as the de facto standard for all shallow to medium surveys. All users of the EM 710 will be offered an upgrade path, making it easy to integrate the EM 712 into their 
operations. 09 Dec 2015 The EM 712 is based on a sophisticated, flexible hardware platform, which enables several performance enhancing features. One of the key benefits that the re-engineered system introduces is 
increased range performance, which is close to double that of the EM 710, resulting in a maximum range of 3600m and a swath coverage of close to 4000m. Other advances include low-noise receiver 
transducers and electronics in addition to a smaller, lighter form factor, enabling for more flexible installation on a wider variety of vessels. Ensuring that the EM 712 can support the same wide range of applications as the system it replaces, it is offered in multiple versions, including a 0.25 x 0.5 degree system for the best range and 
resolution and a smaller, portable 2 x 2 degree system ideal for use on vessels of opportunity. All models are available as full versions for maximum range performance, or as a shallow range version 
without FM chirp enabled. Kongsberg Maritime has also developed an 'entry level' model, with reduced depth performance. The first generation of the EM 710 was released in 2005 and quickly became the standard for shallow to medium range surveys. It was the first true wideband system and the first multibeam echo 
sounder to utilise FM chirp as a transmitting pulse. By introducing these and other features the EM 710 started a paradigm shift in multibeam development. The EM 712 is a natural progression, which 
improves on the ground-breaking EM 710 in every way. ""Today all KONGSBERG EM multibeams use FM chirp and have an unparalleled range and resolution,"" says Helge Uhlen Director of Sales ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Subs""The EM 712 joins our unmatched 
range of industry and technology leading MBE systems, which includes models for very shallow water with very high resolution to large systems for full ocean depths, all in different sizes and shapes 
to fit any application. All of our multibeams have gained a reputation for being highly reliable with the very best performance available and the EM 712 certainly lives up to what is expected of a new

Norwegian AIS satellite?,"Norwegian AIS satellite? Kongsberg Seatex AS will contribute with knowledge and know-how when a payload from Trondheim and a satellite platform developed in Canada can give Norway a better view of activities in ocean areas under national jurisdiction. 25 Jun 2007 AIS provides an overview of ocean traffic. Credit: Norwegian Coastal Administration. Maritime vessels larger than 300 GT are required to carry Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders, which give vessel name, position, speed, course and cargo to neighbouring vessels and to the shore-based AIS network operated by the Norwegian Coastal Administration. AIS improves the safety of life at sea by frequently broadcasting updated traffic information to neighbouring vessels and to the authorities. AIS messages will, however, only be received if vessels are within 40 NM of the AIS network, leaving large Norwegian ocean areas without AIS coverage. This reduces the ability to obtain a reliable overview of the maritime vessel traffic, particularly in the high North. ""Norway was one of the first countries to establish a full shore-based AIS network,"" says Terje Wahl, Chief Scientist at the Norwegian Space Centre. ""It is therefore a natural development to also study the prospects for broadening the AIS coverage through a space-based AIS."" Space-based AIS Space-based AIS covers ocean areas beyond the reach of the ground infrastructure.Courtesy: FFI Studies have been initiated by the Space Centre over the last year to investigate the prospects for building a Norwegian AIS satellite. Last fall the Norwegian government issued a broad strategy for the high North where one recommendation is to pursue the space-based AIS initiative. Space-based AIS is now entering a new phase with the goal to develop a low cost satellite design for an experimental AIS satellite. This design phase will be terminated at the end of 2007. Norwegian and Canadian development The AIS payload will receive and decode AIS information from the maritime vessels. During the second half of 2007 the Trondheim-based company, Kongsberg Seatex, will develop a prototype of the AIS receiver based on the company's leading position in AIS technology. ""Norway has been a leading nation in satellite based earth observation for a long time, and Norwegian industry is in the forefront of the AIS technology development,"" says Terje Wahl. The space group at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment - FFI, has been asked to lead this study and to develop plans for the project. Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace Company (KDA) will be involved with payload fabrication and product assurance. The payload development and the project planning receive funding support both from the Space Centre and from the participating institutions. A Canadian satellite platform design will be adjusted to carry the Norwegian AIS receiver. The platform will be designed and eventually manufactured and tested by the University of Toronto Space Flight Laboratory. The satellite dimensions will 20 x 20 x 20 cm. ""Modern technology has made it possible to build very small and capable satellites, which reduces the launch cost considerably,"" says Terje Wahl at the Norwegian Space Centre. The road ahead The design phase will be terminated at the end of 2007. Norwegian authorities will by then have to decide whether or not to proceed with the manufacturing and launch of the first Norwegian maritime observation satellite. A launch will eventually take place in the 2009 - 2010 time frame. The commissioning and early test and experimentation phase will take about half a year, after which the Coastal Administration, the Directorate of Fisheries, the Coast Guard and other Norwegian authorities can start their evaluation of a new wide area supplement to the coastal AIS network.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/norwegian-ais-satellite/

"Dual HiPAP 500, HAIN Subsea and DP to Flintstone","Dual HiPAP 500, HAIN Subsea and DP to Flintstone 18 Feb 2010 DEME Group's dynamically positioned fall-pipe rock dumper 'Flintstone' which is scheduled for commissioning in early 2011, will include advanced dual HiPAP 500, HAIN Subsea system and DP from Kongsberg Maritime. Flintstone will be operated by Breda based Tideway BV, the offshore specialist company within DEME group. The vessel has a load weight of 19,000 ton and is specially designed for creating high precision structures on the sea bed, using rock and gravel 
in bulk, etc. Typically, the structures are rock capping and bedding on top of or underneath an oil / gas pipeline; rock tables for crossing pipelines and gravel layers for wind turbine foundations etc. The vessel features two large rock bunkers on the 
main deck. In the centre of each rock bunker is a large Liebherr excavator, which discharges into a hopper fitted starboard of the rock dumper. The bulk of each rock bunker is transported to the central hopper by a longitudinal conveyor belt. Subsequently 
a 2000ton/h belt conveys the rock across the beam to the fall pipe. The ID 700 fall pipe hangs in the middle of a moonpool and the rock material falls through this pipe to the seabed. Accurate positioning of the fall pipe mouth is handled by an ROV. Dual HiPAP 500 transducers increases the electrical and acoustic redundancy. Huisman designs and builds the new Stone Dumping Unit. This is a tower like construction mounted over the moonpool, which allows the swift build-up and retrieval of the fall pipe, even in rough seas. Rock bulk production through the fall pipe is controlled 
by means of the rock handling system. The comparatively high DP capability of the all electric propulsion based on 6 thrusters will enable Flintstone to track a pipeline with great accuracy and fast update rate at all times, something which supports the quality of the subsea structures 
being built. The use of two Kongsberg HiPAP 500 transducers increases the electrical and acoustic redundancy, and also increases the accuracy, as it opens for redundant measurement with position estimation based on two independent measurements and a quality control. 
The dual system uses both transducers to measure the position of one single target transponder by separately controlling the beam forming and phase measurement for each system in parallel. HAIN Subsea combines the acoustic measurements from the Dual HiPAP 500 and the readings from the sensors onboard the ROV in an optimum way. The navigation equations update the ROV position, velocity, heading and attitude almost continuously based 
on the readings from the Inertial Measurement Unit. The advanced Kalman filter corrects these values when new acoustic positions and readings from the other ROV sensors are available. This will result in improved position accuracy and update rate compared 
to the acoustic measurements.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/dual-hipap-500-hain-subsea-and-dp-to-flintstone/

New KONGSBERG acoustic positioning operator station for surveyors installed on Bibby Offshore vessel,"New KONGSBERG acoustic positioning operator station for surveyors installed on Bibby Offshore vessel Kongsberg Maritime Ltd, the UK division of Kongsberg Maritime has completed the first ever APOS Survey installation on Bibby Offshore's long term charter vessel, the Olympic Bibby. 
Launched this December, the new APOS Survey operator station enables surveyors to leverage the power of Kongsberg Maritime's de facto industry standard HiPAP High Precision Acoustic Positioning system, 
to deliver accurate survey results simultaneously, whilst the HIPAP is still utilised as a DP position reference. 11 Jan 2016 With state-of-the-art new generation of positioning software for flexible, cost effective subsea survey and construction operations, APOS Survey station offers full LBL and SSBL, quicker mobilisation 
times and is designed for both permanent and temporary installation on vessels, negating the mobilisation cost and time associated with over the side portable transducers. APOS Survey communicates directly with the HiPAP transceiver, which enables the surveyor to operate independently of the bridge. Acoustic interrogations are interleaved or run simultaneously with the 
DP system updates, without making changes to the vessel's APOS software or installation parameters. With APOS Survey, the surveyor can interface local survey grade sensors, IMU, gyro and GNSS, set up 
lever arms and load sound velocity profiles independent of the vessel, thus unlocking the full potential of HiPAP for survey operations. Ed Fennell, sales manager, Subsea of Kongsberg Maritime Ltd's Aberdeen base said: ""This innovative software safely integrates into the vessel's HiPAP system through a high speed optically-isolated 
serial connection to maintain independence from the vessel's Dynamic Positioning (DP) network, and allows the bridge crew to maintain full control of what is shared with APOS Survey. ""Additionally, the software in APOS Survey removes any restrictions normally associated with operating a HiPAP system for survey purposes as it is predominantly used as a (DP) reference system. Having 
Bibby Offshore as our first client to utilise APOS Survey is a fantastic development for Kongsberg Maritime, and we look forward to working closely with Bibby Offshore as they utilise the new product 
for efficient and effective operations,"" adds Fennell. Robin Longstaff, survey manager at Bibby Offshore, said: ""We are very pleased to be the first to utilise this new technology and experience first-hand the benefits that it brings. The built in software 
offers great ease of operation and fully integrates with our existing survey suite, which eliminates the need for further re-training of staff. ""Added to this is its ability to operate independently from the vessel's sensors and settings, which allows us to integrate our survey grade sensors thus unlocking the full positioning potential of 
the vessel's HiPAP. APOS Survey also allows us to quickly and easily add additional ROV transceivers for increased functionality.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/new-kongsberg-acoustic-positioning-operator-station-for-surveyors-installed-on/
Icebreaker Refits Highlight Importance of Upgrading,"Icebreaker Refits Highlight Importance of Upgrading 03 Nov 2010 Upgrading old generation systems with new technology is an important focus area for Kongsberg Maritime. This is reflected in the recent upgrade of the two Finnish icebreakers Fennica and Nordica. Finnish icebreakers Fennica and Nordica recently upgraded by Kongsberg Maritime. Photos courtesy of Arctia Offshore. Arctia Offshore awarded Kongsberg Maritime the contract to upgrade the Dynamic Positioning System, the Power Management System and Alarm and Monitoring System of two of the icebreakers; Nordica and 
Fennica. Built and delivered in the early 90s, the vessels contained an earlier generation ship automation systems delivered by Kongsberg Maritime. ""Over the years, we have been involved in upgrading our own older generation automation and DP systems,"" comments project manager Andrew Stephen in Kongsberg Maritime. ""It has always been important 
during development of new technology to take into consideration the future needs of vessels. We have therefore developed systems specifically for upgrading earlier generations of our systems."" Completed without delays The scope of supply was to install the K-Pos DP System, C-Joy Independent Joystick, K-Chief marine automation system including Power Management, Vessel Management and Alarm and Monitoring systems, 
UPS and distribution, NDU with fiber and STP communication, Tautwire, Wind Sensors and MRU. The upgrade was completed without delays during the vessels' docking periods in 2008 and 2009. Although the project mainly included refitting existing cabinets and operator stations with new electronics, 
the scope of supply also featured some new equipment as well as installation and termination of all new cabling and equipment. While Kongsberg Maritime was responsible for the project, the electrical 
contractor, Callenberg was involved as a subcontractor. The Final Certificate of Conformity for the last of the two vessels, Fennica, marked the end of the two-year upgrade project. ""The Fennica and Nordica upgrades were characterised by a tight schedule with challenging milestones. Our goal was to complete installation and commissioning within the time frame set by Arctia Offshore. 
This was achieved through close co-operation with our customer, detailed planning and a skilled and highly motivated team,"" comments Stephen. Better control Jukka Vuosalmi is First Mate on MSV Nordica and, like all of Arctia's deck officers, is a trained DP-operator and master mariner. When Nordica sailed to the shipyard to be fitted with the latest DP 
technology from Kongsberg Maritime, Vuosalmi was one of the people planning the equipment localisation and supervising the work. ""The new system gives us an even better control over the ship,"" comments Vuosaari. ""It also improves operational reliability and diminishes the need for maintenance. Exterior vision is improved and 
the operator is no longer completely dependent on the monitors. This is important, for example, when working near an oil drilling platform. We have also paid attention to ergonomics where possible. Our 
work is never short of challenges and variation. Our skills are kept up to date through continued training, and the reliability and safety of our vessels is constantly improved by new technology,"" he 
says. Icebreakers Fennica and Nordica operate in the Baltic Sea, providing icebreaking services in the frozen port areas in Finland, including assistance, towing, securing vessel traffic safety, and traffic 
control for vessels proceeding in icy conditions. In addition, they offer offshore services in other areas such as the North Sea and the Mediterranean. The vessels are two of eight icebreakers owned by

Kongsberg Maritime and Becker Marine Systems launches rudder force detection for DP Operations,"Kongsberg Maritime and Becker Marine Systems launches rudder force detection for DP Operations 26 May 2011 Extensive co-operation results in sophisticated new support tool. Illustration photo courtesy Becker Marine Systems. The result of an 18 month joint development project between Kongsberg Maritime and Becker Marine Systems has come to fruition, with the launch of KBIMS; a sophisticated new support 
tool designed to enable more efficient use of propellers and rudders during Dynamic Positioning (DP) operations. A first pilot installation has already been agreed for KBIMS, with a new Volstad offshore 
construction vessel, which is under construction at Fosen. There are several advantages to using main propeller and rudder instead of azimuth thrusters during DP operations. For instance, there is no limitation of installed power and response times may be 
improved, therefore improving station keeping performance overall. However, with conventional rudder-propeller arrangements these benefits, which also include the possibility to reduce vessel emissions, 
are not always available, so Kongsberg Maritime and Becker Marine Systems set about developing KBIMS in order to improve performance for DP operations. ""KBIMS is able to enhance DP operations through several new technical innovations, made possible through Becker's in-depth expertise in rudders and our own DP systems experience,"" explains Nils Albert 
Jensen, VP Business Development, Kongsberg Maritime. ""The challenge was to find a more direct indicator of manoeuvring performance than the vessel's motion reaction detected by GPS or gyros. It clearly 
turned out that the closest value to describe performance was the rudder force itself, so this is what KBIMS measures."" Once KBIMS is integrated with a Kongsberg Maritime K-Pos DP system, it can learn the characteristics of the rudder so the correct combination of rudder angle and propeller pitch/rpm is used. Exact 
measurements of the actual rudder force secures improved station keeping performance and more precise rudder control will reduce wear and tear of steering gear, rudder stock and bearings, so less downtime 
and maintenance costs are possible. Using KBIMS also fulfils regulatory requirements on DP and propulsion systems for long haul offshore operations. In addition to the launch of the sophisticated new KBIMS tool, the two companies have also signed a new cooperation agreement to continue utilising their strengths within high performance rudder systems 
and DP systems respectively to enhance DP capabilities.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/kongsberg-maritime-and-becker-marine-systems-launches-rudder-force-detection-for/

Alfred Wegener Institute evaluates GeoTexture for Backscatter Data Processing in Arctic Nearshore Areas,"Alfred Wegener Institute evaluates GeoTexture for Backscatter Data Processing in Arctic Nearshore Areas 02 Dec 2013 Back in 2012, the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) began assessing the pace of coastal erosion and the nature of sediment and organic matter transfer in 
nearshore areas of the southern Canadian Beaufort Sea. Coastal dynamics on arctic coasts are highly seasonal: ice is present from October to late June, thus the coast is armoured against wave erosion. 
In the short open-water season the coast is subject to the combined effects of mechanical and thermal processes resulting in high erosion rates along ice-rich permafrost coasts, such as the western Canadian 
Arctic. Current estimates show that there is about twice as much carbon stored in permafrost as in the atmosphere. Of special interest is the potential climate feedback triggered by carbon release into 
the nearshore zone by coastal erosion, in a region that according to many climate change models will experience disproportionate warming. A portion of the released carbon is deposited on the continental 
shelf, yet the nearshore dynamics and the possibility of sequestration in shallow waters remains an open question. Within the framework of the Coastal Permafrost Erosion research project (COPER), AWI 
scientists began investigating both the terrestrial coastal dynamics, as well as assessing the fate of sediments and carbon released into the nearshore. An integral part of the fieldwork is seafloor mapping, for which AWI chose the Kongsberg GeoAcoustics GeoSwath Plus Compact multibeam echosounder. In the 2012 field season, c. 3.1 km 2 of survey data were collected, 
along with surface sediment samples. Survey depths ranged from 1 - 17 m. The system delivers high-resolution bathymetry with coverage of up to 12 times the water depth in this shallow water environment 
and co-registered, geo-referenced backscatter data. Decisive factors in operating in remote and harsh environments are the portability and reliability of the equipment. The remote location makes it necessary 
to airlift all equipment and personnel. The surveys were carried out with an inflatable craft on which the splash protected (IP54) system was installed in a portable installation and powered by 24 V battery. Regarding co-registered, geo-referenced backscatter data, AWI has recently evaluated GeoTexture, a Kongsberg GeoAcoustics software suite for backscatter data processing, mosaic creation and seabed 
classification. The performance of the software has been optimized for the analysis of GeoSwath Plus backscatter data, as it allows for beam pattern correction, vessel motion and sea-bottom topography, 
which substantially improve the quality of the mosaics and ease image analysis and interpretation. Compensated backscatter mosaic from the near-shore south-east of the Herschel Island. The data was collected using a Kongsberg GeoSwath Plus Compact bathymetric sonar and processed using GeoTexture 
software suite. The survey vessel is an inflatable craft with the sonar head installed on a retractable pole together with peripheral sensors, motion reference unit, GPS and sound velocity probe. The 
splash protected deck unit is powered by batteries and operated via a ruggedised laptop.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2013/alfred-wegener-institute-evaluates-geotexture-for-backscatter-data-processing-in/
Kongsberg Maritime launches new HiPAP 602  Ultra Deepwater SSBL Positioning Tool,"Kongsberg Maritime launches new HiPAP 602  Ultra Deepwater SSBL Positioning Tool Kongsberg Maritime (KM) has announced the launch of its HiPAP 602 Ultra Deepwater SSBL (Super Short Base Line) Positioning Tool. The newest addition to KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s established portfolio of acoustic positioning systems, the HiPAP 602 has been designed specifically to provide extreme range (up to 7,000m+) and accuracy for positioning ROVs and AUVs, and to operate as a DP reference. 22 Mar 2021 To achieve this performance, the HiPAP 602 replaces the spherical transducer used by the HiPAP 502 with a large-diameter, multi-element planar array combined with electronic beam forming and unique signal processing techniques. This enables narrow transmitter and receiver beams to be generated in all directions within the lower half of the transducer, giving the HiPAP 602 high accuracy and long-range capabilities in a cone directly below the unit. This makes it well suited for deep water operation, especially seabed ms need only a single hull-mounted transducer and a cNODE transponderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ on the subsea vehicle to calculate position in three dimensions, by measuring the range from the shipï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s transducer to the transponder as well as the horizontal and vertical angles. The HiPAP 602 systemï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s enhanced angular measurement accuracy increases the depth that SSBL positioning can be relied upon for survey operations before switching to long baseline positioning techniques (LBL), thereby reducing operational cost. The system is fully compatible with the entire range of existing medium frequency cNODE transponders and modems, with depth ratings available from 100m to 7,000m. HiPaP 602 Transducer The HiPAP 602 shares its modular construction principles with its sister product, the HiPAP 502 acoustic underwater positioning and navigation system, allowing the 502 to be easily converted to a 602 by swapping transducers. For long range towfish tracking the transducer can tible with the latest HAIN Subsea 7000 inertial navigation system, which allows for fast calibration of sparse LBL arrays using the ROV box-in technique. Robust high speed modem capabilities permit third-party control and data transfer to and from subsea sensors, AUVs and Hybrid ROVs. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The HiPAP 602 should not be seen as an upgrade of the 502 ,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Jan Erik Faugstadmo, Product Line Manager, Kongsberg Maritime . ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The two complement one another: the HiPAP 602 is ideally suited to high accuracy operation at extreme depths in a conical zone below the transducer. Outside of those circumstances, the 502 will still be the system of choice. The 602 will be of particular use in contexts such as deep water drilling, research, deep water AUV positioning and deep-sea mining, adding even more versatility to the HiPAP range which has already proven indispensable in a broad variety of subsea applications. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For further09 Read more",hipap|ssbl|positioning|Acoustics,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2021/hipap602/

Kongsberg Maritime Ltd seminar demonstrates new DNV GL dynamic positioning operator training and certificate scheme,"Kongsberg Maritime Ltd seminar demonstrates new DNV GL dynamic positioning operator training and certificate scheme Kongsberg Maritime Ltd, the UK subsidiary of global marine technology company Kongsberg Maritime, welcomed customers to its Aberdeen training centre on Thursday 30th June for a seminar on the 
future of Dynamic Positioning Operator (DPO) Training and Certification. Delegates from operators including Helix, V-Ships and Technip attended the seminar to find out more about the new KONGSBERG 
Training and Certification Scheme for DP Operators, which is certified by DNV GL and recognised by the industry. 07 Jul 2016 The seminar detailed how the KONGSBERG Training Scheme for DP Operators is a step-change in the critical area of DPO training, with teaching and assessor competence, and the use of advanced 
simulators forming the platform for training and certifying. Themes of the seminar included training and certification of DP Operators on vessels and movable drilling units, presented by Capt. Aksel 
D. Nordholm of DNV GL SeaSkill TM . KONGSBERG's Lars E. Rosenhaug Bjorset also gave a presentation detailing a practical way for educating and certifying DP Operators in accordance with the 
DNV GL standard for competence of DP Operators, ST 0023. The final section and an optional part of the seminar involved a live DPO exam streamed from the in-house simulator facility to the meeting room, giving delegates a practical insight into 
KONGSBERG's established methods of DPO training and certification. The seminar received positive feedback with participants interested in the intensive, time saving and competence assuring nature of the new scheme. Debbie Ross, HR Advisor from Helix said: ""The DNV 
GL DP operator training seminar was very insightful, highlighting a new approach to DPO training and certification. The course schedule condensed into a short period and backed up by an exam looks 
like a practical approach to ensuring competence for safe and efficient DP operations when the trainees get to their vessels."" KONGSBERG's DPO Training and Certification Scheme with simulator training and exams has already successfully taken place in Norway, where the Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) considers the DNV GL 
concept to be equivalent to the international recognised standards. Other flag states have also acknowledged the scheme as well. The first UK course is planned to take place in early autumn at 
Kongsberg Maritime Ltd's training facility in Aberdeen. The scheme is based on a three-step program. Step-one focuses on gaining knowledge by covering theory and practical elements with significant time spent on cutting-edge KONGSBERG DP and offshore 
training simulators. Step-two is about gaining experience, and after logging the required sea-time, course participants will return to the training centre to complete their training. For step-three, 
participants can choose to gain training and certification for specific DP operations - Offshore Loading, Drilling or Offshore Operations - all of which require the DPO to take an application specific 
exam. Step-three participants will benefit from highly specialised training in theory, and on application specific simulators. Experienced DPOs will have the option to renew their certificate and 
enter the scheme at step-three. During the whole process, simulator and theoretical exercises are used to monitor student learning levels.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/kongsberg-maritime-ltd-seminar-demonstrates-new-dnv-gl-dynamic-positioning/
Hydroid Upgrades UK Ministry of Defence's REMUS AUV Fleet,"Hydroid Upgrades UK Ministry of Defence's REMUS AUV Fleet Hydroid, Inc., a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime, the leading manufacturer of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), announces that it has received a contract to deliver upgrades to the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence's current fleet of REMUS 100 vehicles. 12 Jan 2012 Hydroid, Inc., a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime, the leading manufacturer of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), announces that it has received a contract to deliver upgrades to the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence's current fleet of REMUS 100 vehicles. Hydroid has received a contract to deliver upgrades to the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence's current fleet of REMUS 100 vehicles. BlueView Technologies 3D MicroBathymetry systems and Kongsberg GeoAcoustics GeoSwath interferrometric sonar will now be integrated with the vehicles, ensuring greater capabilities for the Royal Navy's mine clearance and hydrographic operations. The vehicles will also be fitted with modular endcaps and digital ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic positioning systems. Some of the fleet's twelve REMUS 100 vehicles will be equipped with Inertial Navigation Systems as well. Hydroid's REMUS AUVs are modular and may be fitted with a large number of different types of sensors to meet the customer's needs. In this case, the BlueView systems will provide high resolution 2D and 3D imagery in the region directly below the AUV ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ an area that often has a coverage gap which requires overlapping passes in order to cover the survey region. The 3D MicroBathymetry will fill that gap and eliminate the need for any overlapping passes. GeoSwath interferometric sonar will allow for unprecedented rapid survey coverage in shallow waters. Interferometric sonar (IFMS) is an emergent technology that provides significant advantages in shoal areas where Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) use is not feasible or of too low a resolution to be useful. IFMS systems accurately measure depths at precise locationexactly spaced phase differencing transducer elements. ""We are pleased that the Ministry of Defence has decided to update its fleet of REMUS 100 vehicles,"" said Graham Lester, Director of Hydroid Europe. ""Hydroid's innovative use of gap filler BlueView sonar will greatly enhance the Royal Navy's existing sidescan sonar area coverage rate on the REMUS 100, while the integration of the GeoSwath interferrometric sonar will be the first military use of this technology with an AUV"". The Ministry of Defence's current fleet of REMUS 100 vehicles has been in operation since March 2006. The Royal Navy also employs several REMUS 600 vehicles, which play a primary role in mine reconnaissance and also conduct hydrographic surveys and environmental assessments. The combined vehicles have provided reliable and proven capabilities for the Royal Navy's underwater search and survey operations. REMUS AUVs have been used to aid in hydrographic surveys, harbor security operations, debris field mapping, scientific sampling and mapping, as well as many basic and applied research programs funded by ONR and DARPA. With over 200 vehicles in the field, Hydroid is currently the AUV market leader with systems in use around the world.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2012/hydroid-upgrades-uk-ministry-of-defences-remus-auv-fleet/

The Kongsberg EA 400 sonar records show a wreck consistent with photographs of the tug boat. The survey equipment was loaned to Northwestern Michigan College by Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. The Great Lakes Hydrographic Survey Project will provide key scientific information and facilitate technical competencies and educational opportunities for NMC students. The project will constitute a major portion of the curriculum of NMC's new Freshwater Studies degree, the first such Associate Degree program in the nation. Students will develop case studies and field projects based on the survey data. A launching pad for knowledge In addition, cadets in NMC's Great Lakes Maritime Academy will have the unique opportunity for hands-on training with the hydrographic survey technology. The data will be shared with governmental agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Potentially it could serve as a template project for a hydrographic survey of all five Great Lakes ""The idea is that the information will be shared. What we want this to be is the launching pad for knowledge and appreciation for what this means for our waters"" said Hans VanSumeren, Director of GLWSI. VanSumeren said the equipment will collect imagery from the bottom of the bay to centimeter resolution. The data will be collected in a 1,000-foot swath from the moving NORTHWESTERN. ""Basically it's a motion picture of the bottom. That's the kind of resolution we'll get,"" VanSumeren said, adding that the technology will provide much more accurate depth measurements than currently exists. ""The technology has advanced so much that we probably don't know the true depths of our lake in certain positions,"" he said. Advanced hydrographic surveys Assisted by Michigan Sea Grant, NMC is conducting advanced hydrographic surveys of both east and west arms of Grand Traverse Bay and northern Lake Michigan this summer and again in 2010. The first phase of underwater research is being conducted with single beam and side-scan sonar equipment aboard the NMC Research Vessel NORTHWESTERN. Since existing data dates to the 1920s, the survey project will provide important updated and expanded information with multiple applications, including environmental impact assessments, commercial navigation charts and supporting fisheries. ""The Great Lakes continue to be challenged by both natural and human-induced stressors, including the changing climate, continued introductions of non-native invasive species and lake level fluctuations,"" said VanSumeren. ""These stressors have dramatically altered the Great Lakes ecosystem, our near shore waters and nearly all of our navigable waters and harbors, but existing data is outdated and does not accurately reflect how the ecosystem has changed.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2009/kongsberg-ea-400-survey-system-locates-tug-boat-missing-for-thirty-years/

The unit, which supersedes the current AIS 200BF, offers outstanding secure mode abilities alongside unique AIS receiver sensitivity and robustness ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ refinements made possible by Kongsberg Seatex's involvement in a number of pioneering AIS space projects. 01 Apr 2014 The AIS 300BF is tailor-made for vessels undertaking demanding coast guard, anti-piracy, navy and boarder police operations. The AIS 300BF is tailor-made for vessels undertaking demanding coast guard, anti-piracy, navy and boarder police operations. Simple to install and maintain, on any vessel regardless of type or size, the Class A mobile station allows 'friendly forces' to identify vessel transmission of their own AIS information. However, this data can be freely transmitted between Blue Force vessels in encrypted format, with the unit decrypting incoming information to facilitate effective multi-vessel communication and collaboration. Kongsberg Seatex's experience developing an AIS receiver for use in space ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ first launched upon the Norwegian AIS satellite AISSat-1 in July 2010 and currently in use in the International Space Station ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ laid the foundation for the firm to enhance the receiver technology in this, its latest BF unit. The AIS 300BF thus offers market-leading reliability and sensitivity, pro""This is an important step forward in the evolution of our BF AIS offering,"" comments Arne Rinnan, CTO, Kongsberg Seatex. ""Kongsberg Seatex has been developing these units with proven success since 2002/03, when the USCG installed our first generation AIS BF, AIS 110BF, on its vessels as part of the Hawkeye project. The AIS 300BF marks the zenith of our achievements; a compact, lightweight, precise yet robust unit that both encrypts and decrypts data internally, giving our customers the best possible platform for operational success."" With units placed on (for example) large military vessels and smaller combat craft, AIS 300BF can keep track of, and help coordinate (through encrypted data exchange), multiple 'friendly' craft, such as RIBs, as they tackle the situation.

A battle to reopen the search Amundsen's plane and its crew disappeared on the 18th of June 1928 on a mission to save the Italian general and aviation engineer Umberto Nobile. Despite a search directly after the disappearance of the Latham 47 plane, only a pontoon and one single fuel tank were found. 75 years after Amundsen vanished, the Norwegian Aviation Museum decided to reinvestigate the disappearance. A search was carried out in 2004, but had to be called off due to bad weather. Since then, the Norwegian Aviation Museum has fought a battle to reopen the search, and today they start what might be the final chapter in the mystery of the disappearance. ""It is hard to estimate our chances of finding the airplane. The fabric of the wings will be gone by now, but the 8 cylinder engine is quite unique for its time and will be easy to identify if it is found. The search area is estimated based on stories from eyewitnesses and previous findings"", says the former director of the Norwegian aviation museum, Kjell M.

Kongsberg Maritime delivers High Speed Vessel Simulator to NSSR,"Kongsberg Maritime delivers High Speed Vessel Simulator to NSSR Kongsberg Maritime recently completed the installation of a high speed vessel simulator for NSSR's sea rescue school in Stavern, Norway. 05 Dec 2008 This simulator is very important to us because it helps improve our competence within search and rescue work, something which contributes to increased safety at sea, said General Manager at the Sea Rescue School, Jarl Berge Larsen. Increased knowledge of search and rescue The simulator is equipped with a cockpit bridge that replicates the high speed vessels that the NSSR already has at its disposal. The sea rescue school was established in October last year with the purpose of improving courses for NSSR's own crew aiming to increase their competence within search and rescue. Simulated training is highly useful for this purpose and Kongsberg Maritime was the preferred supplier. We chose Kongsberg Maritime both because of quality and price. In addition we've had a previous collaboration where KONGSBERG donated vessels for our Simrad fleet, said Larsen. He further emphasises the importance of this simulator when adapting courses for NSSR's own crew. Most importantly, the simulator will enable us to create cases adapted to our needs. For instance, we can add factors such as extreme weather conditions in order to practice scenarios that are too dangerous to practice in real life. As a result, our crew will be better prepared for authentic situations, said Larsen. The simulator is equipped with a cockpit bridge that replicates the high speed vessels that the NSSR already has at its disposal. Three new hydrodynamic models have also been produced enabling the simulators to realistically mimic NSSR's newest rescue boats. Even though NSSR's own personnel has the first priority on using the simulator, the school is also considering to offer courses for drivers of large, high-speed leisure boats. According to Larsen, this will only be possible when all of their employees have received the mandatory training. Important delivery According to sales engineer, Svein Holmï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½y, Kongsberg Maritime is very pleased to have been chosen as supplier for this project. We cover large markets world wide, but this delivery is very important to us. We know that NSSR has unique competence within its field and we need professional clients like this. The fact that we will have a school like this in our local area focusing on maritime safety and knowledge is highly favourable. We are happy that NSSR chose us, said Holmï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½y. About NSSR NSSR is a humanitarian organization, committed to saving lives and recovering property at sea, by maintaining rescue services along the Norwegian coast and neighbouring sea areas. They have 180 officers, 600-700 volunteers and 40 vessels connected to their operations.

Hydroid will provide the AUVs to support operations at the Pioneer Array, a component of the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (OL) announced that Hydroid, a KONGSBERG Company, will provide Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and 
docking stations to support the Pioneer Array of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). WHOI, an implementing organization on the OOI Program, awarded the contract for approximately $1 million to Hydroid for initial development and design modification of AUV systems to meet OOI 
specifications. Subsequent phases of the contract will lead to the delivery of production AUVs that will be used to collect data as a part of the OOI Pioneer Array located off the New England coast. The Pioneer Array spans the continental shelf-break, where water depths drop quickly from about 100 meters to greater than 500 meters over a distance of about 40 km. The shelf break is a region of 
energetic and important ocean variability, a boundary region between cool coastal waters and warmer offshore and Gulf Stream waters. Biological productivity and variability are strong, and a goal of 
the Pioneer Array is to understand the interplay of physical and biological processes across many scales, from hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers. The Pioneer Array AUVs will be dedicated to 
sustained operation in the vicinity of the shelf break, with each vehicle capable of making more than 50 missions per year in water depths up to 600 m. ""AUVs are a critical tool to rapidly sample variability on dynamically relevant scales within the complex frontal system,"" said Al Plueddemann, a WHOI senior scientist and project scientist for the 
Pioneer Array. ""This capability is key to improving our understanding of interactions between the continental shelf and slope."" Mobile platforms like AUVs provide oceanographers with the ability to deploy sensors and move them through space horizontally and vertically. Propeller-driven, battery powered AUVs look somewhat 
like an instrumented torpedo, though they are optimized for longer life at slower speeds while carrying a sensor payload. AUVs are able to carry a broad suite of sensors to conduct a diverse variety 
of observations. AUVs surface to obtain position fixes using GPS and also will enter the OOI communications network using satellite telemetry. The OOI, a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), is planned as a networked infrastructure of science-driven sensor systems to measure the physical, chemical, geological and 
biological variables in the ocean and seafloor. As a fully integrated system, OOI will collect and disseminate data on coastal, regional and global scales. Through a unique cyberinfrastructure, OOI 
will make ocean observing data available to anyone with an internet connection. Greater knowledge of the oceanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s interrelated systems is vital for increased understanding of their effects on

KONGSBERG system suppresses superfluous alarms,"KONGSBERG system suppresses superfluous alarms 12 Apr 2011 The Flagship maritime transport project has developed software that enables comprehensive suppression of audible warnings in order to avoid large cascades of alarms on the bridge and in the 
engine room. KONGSBERG iCAS - Intelligent Central Alarm System designed to provide precise overview of the situation as it develops while freeing up staff to address the situation and follow the vessel's routines without disturbance. Precise overview Known as iCAS (intelligent central alarm system), the system is designed to provide a precise overview of the situation on board as it develops while freeing up staff to address the situation. Focused operations This element of the pan-European Flagship maritime transport project included both a theoretical analysis and a practical exercise in the development of a new integrated alarm system complete with 
display. Proven methodology from the offshore industry was used to create an alarm shelving and grouping function. The resulting system was used in a simulation of a real incident on an LNG tanker, where 
a full blackout generated many thousand alarms over a few minutes and more thousands during the next few days. The system focuses on alarm grouping in order to give overview and criticality and also use 
temporary shelving of spurious alarms to allow much reduced disturbance and more focussed operations on board. Tests were made with experienced bridge officers and the system was well received. The Flagshipï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ iCAS project was led by Kongsberg Maritime in Norway and was supported, delivered and trialled in conjunction with Marintek, Teekay and Autronica also of Norway, and ASME and Minoan of 
Greece. The Flagship project is part-funded by the EU and involves more than 40 companies and organisations. Instant overview and situation summary Geir Hasnes, principal engineer at Kongsbe""In addition to introducing the grouping and shelving capability, we have created a central alarm screen which delivers an instant 
overview and situation summary. The noise reduction in critical situations is almost unbelievable. We are confident that the concept will be integrated into standard products over the coming years. A 
full demonstration bridge with a simulator incorporating the iCAS system has been built at the Kongsberg Maritime facility in Norway so that ship owners can see the system operating in lifelike conditions. 
Responses have been very positive so far"". Tage Thorsen of Teekay Shipping said: ""We had an initial demonstration of the system in our office and the group that joined the demonstration were astonished by the 'silent' bridge concept. We look 
forward seeing the system demonstrated on the bridge simulator at Kongsberg Maritime."" Performance and efficiency Herman de Meester, coordinator of Flagship, commented: ""Flagship has pursued the twin objectives of reducing still further both risk and the environmental impact of the world's commercial fleet whilst 
generating the opportunity for real commercial benefits.

HiPAP 350 hydroacoustic tracking system chosen for Girassol FPSO,"HiPAP 350 hydroacoustic tracking system chosen for Girassol FPSO TOTAL Exploration & Production Angola has recently equipped the GIRASSOL FPSO (Block 17, Offshore Angola) with a Riser Tower Monitoring System. 05 Dec 2008 The three 1300-meter-high riser towers, located 200m away from the barge are mounted with MPT319/DT transponders at the top, 50m below the surface. The aim of such a system is to provide real time positions of the towers and activate an alarm in case of unusual movement. The three 1300-meter-high riser towers, located 200m away from the barge are mounted with MPT319/DT transponders at the top, 50m below the surface. The KONGSBERG HiPAP 350P acoustic system was chosen to provide the top of the risers' positions relative to the FPSO. The transceiver deployed on a pole alongside the hull is interfaced to the APOS computer through a subsea junction box and a Fibre-Optic topside converter. The custom built junction box is used to convert the fibre optic signals from surface to the HiPAP 350P transceiver and to convert the surface 220V AC power to 48V DC. Also, due to the limited depth of the top of the risers, this pole is equipped with a special 30 degree angled flange to provide full tracking from surface to 120 degrees down. This monitoring acoustic solution was mobilised and installed by Fugro Survey BV, which also designed a dedicated application based on Fugro Starfix (SEIS module) to recover positioning data and to compute, log and display it for long term analysis. An initial situation based on the first months of logging will be analyzed and the average positions and standard deviations will be defined as the nominal 3D-positions in order to highlight excessive movements that should set off the alarms. The system is also designed to take into consideration the FPSO capacity using 3 states - full, half empty and empty - that have a direct effect on the relative riser tower elevation. Any deviation out of the nominal values will indicate damage or malfunction on the buoyancy tanks and thus provide further controls that may not be noticed during the regular inspection surveys.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/hipap-350-hydroacoustic-tracking-system-chosen-for-girassol-fpso/

IFMGEOMAR conducts exploration of the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s oceans, including missions that study the geology of the seafloor bottom and maritime meteorology. The institute plans to use the deep-diving REMUS 6000, Hydroidï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s versatile25 meters to 6000 meters, to autonomously carry a payload to great depth in order to measure ocean water characteristics and map the seabed. IFM-GEOMAR will use its REMUS 6000 to further the study of volcanic and tectonic processes at mid-ocean spreading ridges and to understand how these processes influence hydrothermalism, a process where superheated seawater circulating within the newly formed rock is eventually ejected into the overlying ocean as buoyant hydrothermal plumes. Measurements of the seafloor and water column at high spatial and temporal resolution are required to conduct this research. Due to its autonomous, bottom-following operational mode, the REMUS 6000 is able to carry a payload to great depth in order to measure ocean water characteristics, including conductivity, temperature, chemical composition, map and image the seabed through bathymetry, side scan sonar, magnetics, gravimetry and photography. The REMUS 6000 system has a basic configuration consisting of vehicle, swath bathymetric, sidescan and sediment-penetrating sonars, optical backscatter sensor, navigation units, communications equipment and the facilities to transport, deploy, service and maintain the vehicle when at sea.

Streamline reporting with new generation of electronic logbooks from Kongsberg Maritime,"Streamline reporting with new generation of electronic logbooks from Kongsberg Maritime K-Log, Kongsberg Maritime's new line of Electronic Logbooks, will be launched at Nor-Shipping 2015 (stand C03-24). The K-Log portfolio currently includes five user-friendly Electronic Logbooks designed 
to reduce the time that Masters and Officers spend on mandatory reporting by streamlining data collection and delivery, meeting the requirements of IMO, Marpol, SOLAS and 11 flag states. 02 Jun 2015 K-Log is designed to replace traditional paper logbooks by collecting data and information into a single data storage platform, either manually or automatically. K-Log is designed to replace traditional paper logbooks by collecting data and information into a single data storage platform, either manually or automatically. The system supports event based recording 
of data related to navigation, engine, garbage handling, port calls and other operational activities, within the five currently available logbooks: Engine, Deck, Oil Record Book 1, Radio and Garbage. 
Kongsberg Maritime will soon add Dynamic Positioning, Operational and Official Electronic Logbooks to the system, with more planned for the future. A key aspect of K-Log's design is that all Electronic Logbooks provide a high degree of recognition from traditional paper logbooks, ensuring that users are already familiar with the layout. This makes 
the interface easy to learn and interact with, which along with simplified reporting routines and automatic collection of data, helps to reduce workload for officers on watch, so they can focus on safe 
and efficient vessel operations. Additionally, with greater automation, K-Log improves the quality of logbook entries by minimising the opportunity for human error. An on shore version of K-Log can also 
be included, making signed logbook pages available for authorized personnel. K-Log is a highly adaptable software platform that can be customised to fit specific vessels or fleets, taking into account individual requirements of event set up and structure. It features customisable 
shortcuts to events and certain events can be recorded at specific times or in a sequence. The customer can define these rules under proposed events. Additionally, some events are recorded in multiple 
logbooks, reducing workload even further, i.e., an event recorded in the Deck Logbook can be sent to the Engine Logbook as a pre-filled suggested event. The officer responsible for the Engine Logbook 
only has to confirm before it is stored as an entry. ""By providing efficient and trouble-free logging, and more efficient information exchange with simplified reporting routines, K-Log helps vessels to make the most out of recent regulations that permit 
paperless reporting,"" said Hans Otto Schjerven, General Manager ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Product, Kongsberg Maritime's Me""Electronic logbooks offer a wealth of functionality not available with paper. 
For instance, K-Log reduces time needed to duplicate entries across logbooks, whilst ensuring more accurate reporting as much of the data can be pulled in automatically. We strongly believe that K-Log 
can save time and money and this is reflected by very positive feedback from our trial customers.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2015/streamline-reporting-with-new-generation-of-electronic-logbooks-from-kongsberg/

Ocean Rig's semi-submersible drilling rig Leiv Eiriksson has successfully navigated the Bosporus Strait using the sophisticated new DPS 4D Differential Positioning System developed by Kongsberg Maritime's specialist position reference and satellite 
positioning division, Kongsberg Seatex. Leiv Eiriksson is one of the first vessels to apply DPS 4D, which uses the latest advances in GPS/GLONASS technology, aided by inertial technology utilizing Kongsberg Seatex's new high performance Motion Reference 
Unit, MRU 5+, to optimise signal tracking, integrity and availability for Dynamic Positioning (DP) applications under challenging GNSS conditions. Position data at all times Ocean Rig reports that DPS 4D provided continuous, accurate position data during the transit of the Bosporus Strait, demonstrating integrity and availability of position data at all times. ""The Bosporus Strait is well recognised as being a hazardous area for navigation. Despite the bridges and other obstacles, which actually interrupted other satellite-based reference systems onboard, we were able to reference our position continuously, 
only because we had DPS 4D. The availability of position data helps to improve safety and efficiency of operations and I'm confident that DPS 4D will enhance future navigation and manoeuvring operations for Leiv Eiriksson,"" comments Stein Egil Svendsen, 
Marine Manager at Ocean Rig. GPS / GLONASS and MRU 5+ KONGSBERG DPS 4D utilises all available satellite navigation signals by combining GPS / GLONASS and MRU 5+ into a single system. The MRU 5+ measurements effectively bridge gaps in the satellite signal caused by physical obstructions, ionosphere activity 
and shadowing from nearby objects which may reduce signal availability. RIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) enhanced by data from MRU 5+ also provides an assessment of the reliability of position and velocity data under challenging GNSS conditions. 
DPS 4D is also designed to utilise all frequencies in systems available today as well as future GNSS signals and future global satellite navigation systems such as GALILEO. Visual presentation is available KONGSBERG DPS 4D has an intuitive and easy to use Human Machine Interface (HMI) developed in close co-operation with end-users. The primary goal of the HMI is to enable the operator to instantly identify and react safely to critical situations. Operators 
need to assess the quality of their position quickly and effectively so user-defined visual presentation using multiple layers of information is available. Decimetre accuracy The KONGSBERG DPS product line is well-proven and in use by professional marine and offshore users worldwide. Kongsberg Seatex has years of position reference experience and adds the DPS 4D to its existing top level DPS range comprising DPS 132, DPS

Refitting Scarabeo 5 semi-submersible drilling rig,"Refitting Scarabeo 5 semi-submersible drilling rig 20 May 2009 Scarabeo 5 semi-submersible drilling rig. Kongsberg Maritime recently completed the refit of the Saipem owned Scarabeo 
5, a semi-submersible drilling rig, kept in position by eight Rolls-Royce anchor 
winches and eight Kamewa Azimuth Thrusters. The extensive refit project was based on upgrading and expanding the existing 
Kongsberg Maritime vessel management, integrated control and dynamic positioning 
systems and covered hardware and software upgrades, engineering, installation/supervision 
and commissioning. During the refit, K-Chief 700 marine automation system from Kongsberg 
Maritime was installed. About Scarabeo 5 Scarabeo 5 was built at the Fincantieri shipyard (Genova), Italy and delivered 
in 1990. Kongsberg Maritime originally installed the Albatross Vessels Management 
- AVM and Dynamic Positioning Mooring System - ADPM together with a Hydroacoustic 
Position Reference - HPR system, all of which were integrated with a dual redundant 
network interface between all the nodes in the control systems. The scope of the refit Specifically, the scope of the refit project included the upgrading of the AVM 
system to the latest technology and the expansion of the Integrated Control System 
- ICS to include full main and backup control of ballast systems, Diesel Driven 
Generator auxiliary equipment (including safety systems) and Drilling Monitoring 
and Control System. The new system contains approximately 6500 I/O Signals and was 
fully integrated with the Dynamic Positioning system that Kongsberg Maritime had 
already upgraded in 2005. Additionally, Kongsberg Maritime assisted Saipem with 
the redesign/rebuild of the Wheelhouse and engine control room operator environments 
to comply with Norsok/ergonomic recommendations. During the Dynamic Positioning Mooring System upgrade carried out by Kongsberg 
Maritime Customer Support and personnel from contractor Servie AS a pre-study for 
the RMCS upgrade was carried out, with network cables and distribution units pre-prepared. The refit project was planned in 2007 with commissioning taking place over a 
sixty day period in Olen, Norway late summer 2008. As a part of the contract, the 
project is still live for one year after the customer acceptance test, and will 
end early autumn 2009. The reason for this is the complexity of the retrofit and 
the obvious need for variation orders that Saipem want to address to the same project 
organization and personnel.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2009/refitting-scarabeo-5-semi-submersible-drilling-rig-/

Kongsberg Maritime unveils innovative solutions to industrialise floating offshore wind turbine installation,"Kongsberg Maritime unveils innovative solutions to industrialise floating offshore wind turbine installation Kongsberg Maritime has unveiled a range of innovative methods designed to transform and industrialise the transportation and installation (T&I), of floating offshore wind turbines. 06 February 2025 Text: Global Sales and Marketing Photo: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Kongsberg Maritime These new solutions promise to streamline the entire process, from anchor and mooring installation through to electrical cable pull-in, ensuring that turbines are ready to be connected to energy grids, and offer a comprehensive solution for the floating offshore wind market. The solutions are part of a broader strategic effort that Kongsberg Maritime has put in to contribute towards the emerging floating offshore wind market, with more initiatives in the works. Gunnar Thorsen, Senior Vice President of Business Concepts at Kongsberg Maritime, highlights the significance of the""We aim to offer a full package of equipment and technology, from the point the floating turbines leave their assembly site to the moment they are connected to the power grid. Our new methods for anchor tensioning, mooring installation, tow-out, and cable pull-in will represent a big leap forward in the industrialisation of floating wind installation. They are also applicable to other offshore energy structures, so our investment in these novel solutions will also be relevant and benefit oil and gas related operations."" Our new methods for anchor tensioning, mooring installation, tow-out, and cable pull-in will represent a big leap forward in the industrialisation of floating wind installation. Four of the elements highlighted in this new, offshore floating wind approach, are: new vessel designs and methodology for anchor and mooring installation; a new approach for towing turbines to site; a new integrated tensioning concept for mooring lines; and an innovative cable pull-in system. Innovative vessel designs for efficient anchor and mooring and installation Two new vessel concepts, specifically designed for large-scale mooring and installation operations, are a key element in the new novel solutions. The Floating Wind Installation Vessels (FWIVs) are designed to handle the unique challenges of transport and installation of floating wind turbines, as well as other offshore and subsea structures. The anchor handling version (UT 7900 FWIV AH) features a triple cross-tensioning winch system capable of tensioning and proof-loading up to three mooring lines simultaneously with significant reduction in bollard pull requirements. This vessel can pull up to 900 tonnes in a single fall configuration, ensuring efficient and safe anchor handling, with reduced energy consumption. This vessel offers a new approach, and because of the high volume and repetitive nature of the operations, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve built in additional rope and chain storage. The wholeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½point behind this new set-up is that you deploy the rope, while preparing the next one, and do it in a safe environment, which you canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t do on a normal anchor handler. Gunnar Thorsen, Senior Vice President of Business Concepts at Kongsberg Maritime The subsea construction vessel design concept, (UT 7600 FWIV Subsea), is equipped with advanced systems for handling, storing, and deploying mooring elements, making it ideal for high-volume floating wind installations. Tow Assist - Empowering safe and efficient towing operations To addrelds, Kongsberg Maritime has developed Tow Assist. This innovative approach combines Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s leading edge Dynamic Positioning (DP) technology with operational analysis to improve situational awareness, safety and efficiency throughout all stages of the towing operation. Tow Assist builds on the K-Pos DP system, enabling unpowered floating structures to become DP-enabled during complex towing operations by calculating and distributing the optimal allocation of the connected vessels. Successfully trialled in the North Sea last year, the Tow Assist system provides real-time situational awareness through graphical guidance for precise and efficient positioning, transforming the way floating offshore structures are moved and positioned. Integrated Tensioning for simpler operations The Integrated Tensioning Concept is a solution designed to enhance the efficiency and safety of mooring line hook-up operations. This system compensates for relative movements between the floater antly increasing the operational weather window and ensuring smoother operations. The new concept utilises Kongsberg Maritime's advanced Permanent Magnet (PM) winches, known for their high torque and dynamic capabilities. These winches are a key component of the system, providing the responsiveness and motion compensation necessary for precise and efficient tensioning of mooring lines. The PM winches' ability to handle large loads with rapid response makes them ideal for the challenging conditions of offshore operations. The Integrated Tensioning Concept monitors the motion of the floater, allowing the vessel winch to compensate, removing peak loads and hazardous situations. This results in a much smoother hook-up process and significantly increases the operational weather window Runar Hjelle, Sales Director Offshore Construction & Support at Kongsberg Maritime Innovative cable pull-in for year-round operations A new method for cable pull-in operations, is a key element of Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½aness by reducing requirements for equipment and people on the floater, enhancing safety and speeding up the overall rate of installation of the wind farm array. Gunnar Thorsen, adds: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½At present, cable pull-in operations require mobilising equipment such as winches, power packs and fuel tanks on the floating turbine. Personnel must be on board the floater after it has been hooked up to perform the cable pull-in. However, with the new, patented method, all necessary equipment is placed on the vessel, significantly reducing the complexity and risk associated with the operation. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This new approach offers several advantages, including enhanced safety by reducing the number of people onboard the floater, to a minimum during the pull-in operation. Equipment lifting operations and personnel transfer are minimised which allows operations to continue in harsher weather conditions.

Marine Technology Society recognises Kongsberg Maritime Embient for its contribution to the field of subsea monitoring,"Marine Technology Society recognises Kongsberg Maritime Embient for its contribution to the field of subsea monitoring 23 Sep 2014 Kongsberg Maritime Embient last week received the 2014 Compass International Award for outstanding contributions to the advancement of marine science and technology from the Marine Technology Society 
(MTS). The German subsea technology specialist and systems integrator, which is wholly owned by Kongsberg Maritime, a leading maritime, offshore and subsea technology developer, was given the award at 
the OCEANS 2014 exhibition in Canada on 16th September 2014. K-Observer hydro acoustic monitoring system for detection of scour, deformation, marine growth and corrosion on and around underwater structures. Embient was established in 2010 with focus on technology sourcing and integration of subsea technologies into complete packages and solutions. Over the last four years the company has developed a strong 
in-house competence within underwater inspection and monitoring, as well as on subsea leak detection. Acquired by Kongsberg Maritime in December 2013, Embient is located close to Hamburg. Kongsberg Maritime Embient has played a key role in the development of the Kongsberg Maritime Modular Subsea Monitoring (MSM) network, which drew the attention of the MTS Award judges. The modularity 
and scalability of the MSM concept allows for an easy adaptation to different monitoring tasks, ranging from very early leak detection and condition monitoring on and around subsea structures to environmental 
monitoring on the seabed and in the water column. By connecting different Nodes on different locations in a subsea network, MSM based systems can model and predict the impact of man-made structures, such 
as wind turbines and oil & gas rigs, on complex environments and vice versa. In 2014, Kongsberg Maritime Embient launched the first systems based on the MSM concept. 'K-POINT' is a compact leak detection system for critical underwater structures (BOPs, trees, PLEMs, flowlines). 
'K-LANDER' is a modular and scalable sensor carrier for permanent subsea monitoring systems, whilst 'K-OBSERVER', which is launched at WindEnergy Hamburg 2014, is a hydro acoustic monitoring system for 
detection of scour, deformation, marine growth and corrosion on and around underwater structures. ""We're privileged to have been recognised by the Marine Technology Society for our contribution to subsea monitoring advances,"" comments Sï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ren Themann Managing Director, Kongsberg Mar""Our work with Kongsberg Maritime Subsea on the MSM concept has resulted in an advanced system that can produce tangible time and cost savings for wind turbine operators whilst also significantly reducing 
the environmental impact of subsea structures, construction and offshore energy.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/marine-technology-society-recognises-kongsberg-maritime-embient-for-its/

More KONGSBERG Multibeams for U.S. Academic Institutions,"More KONGSBERG Multibeams for U.S. Academic Institutions Two more U.S. academic vessels, the R/V Marcus G. Langseth and the R/V Melville, have recently been outfitted with KONGSBERG deep water multibeam systems, and a portable EM 3002D shallow water system (now available as the EM 2040) has been ordered by an institution on the East Coast. 04 Dec 2007 The R/V Marcus G. Langseth is a 71.5 m long, 2578 ton research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. EM 122 for R/V Marcus G. Langseth When the R/V Maurice Ewing was retired by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) in 2004, the former Norwegian seismic vessel Western Legend was acquired as a replacement and renamed the R/V Marcus G. Langseth. The vessel has since undergone major modifications to make it the primary geophysical research vessel in the U.S. academic fleet. In addition to a seismic system with both 2D and 3D capabilities, the modifications also included the installation of a 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ EM 120 multibeam echo sounder and preparations for future addition of a KONGSBERG sub-bottom profiler. The installation of the 3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ SBP 120 system, which may occur in 2008, will further enhance the extensive geophysical capabilities of this vessel. The EM 120 system presently installed will be changed to an EM 122 when this upgrade path becomes available, also, most likely, in 2008. With both the vessel recertification and the commissioning of the EM 120 already completed, the R/V Marcus G. Langseth is expected to enter science operations in late 2007 or early 2008. One of this vessel's primary missions will be to survey deep water drill sites as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. EM 122 for R/V Melville Multibeam data from the Gulf of Mexico collected with R/V Marcus G. Langseth during commissioning of the EM 120 system in October 2007. The R/V Melville is a large, multi-mission oceanographic research vessel ate as many as 38 scientists on expeditions lasting up to 40 days. First launched in 1970, the Melville underwent major refurbishing and lengthening around 1990, at which time a Seabeam 2000 multibeam system was installed. This system was recently replaced by a 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Kongsberg EM 120 multibeam echo sounder at the SSK Shipyard in Sasebo, Japan. Following successful at-sea testing and commissioning, the EM 120 system was accepted by Scripps in October this year. As part of the contract, Kongsberg will upgrade this EM 120 to an EM 122 when this next generation system becomes available. Another vessel operated by Scripps, the R/V Roger Revelle, is also equipped with a 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ EM 120. Upgrading this system to an EM 122 is also in Scripps' plans. EM 3002D for Coastal Carolina University The Center for Marine and Wetland Studies at Coastal Carolina University will significantly increase the scope of geophysical research along the South Carolina coo Sounder within the next couple of months. A Seatex Seapath 200 vessel reference system is also part of the delivery. According to center director Paul Gayes, professor of marine science and geology, the addition of the EM 3002D establishes an integrated state-of-the-art mapping capability. With the acquisition of this equipment the center will have the means to conduct highly advanced, comprehensive profiling and mapping of the ocean floor. Together with other advanced instrumentation this will make it possible for center scientists and students to study how sediments and near shore reef environments interact with waves and currents moving above. The data derived from these studies will have many important applications, from planning beach renourishment projects to the management of fishing habitats.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/more-kongsberg-multibeams-for-u.s.-academic-institutions

Enhancements on the International Space Station (ISS) on its way,"Enhancements on the International Space Station (ISS) on its way After close to 350 million AIS messages from over 142 000 different unique ships, the highly successful NORAIS ship-detection system from KONGSBERG/FFI on the International Space Station is to be 
upgraded. The next generation NORAIS 2 has several enhancements compared to the original NORAIS and is scheduled to be launched on the autonomous space vehicle, SpaceX on December 19. 17 Dec 2014 The Columbus AIS (COLAIS) experiment began in June 2010, detecting signals from Automatic Identification System (AIS) units, mostly carried on a mandatory basis by all commercial vessels. The experiment was to verify how AIS signals propagate up to Earth orbit and investigate the usability of an in-orbit AIS detecting satellite as a supplement to terrestrial AIS infrastructure. The 
latter has a limited range, and a satellite constellation would be complementary to cover blind spots in open oceans. The exploitation of this technology in a fully deployed space based system will improve the safety for ocean-going vessels in open sea, and also simplify the identification and coordination of vessels 
in a search and rescue situation. In addition it can be used for monitoring vessels carrying hazardous cargo and for other environmental risk assessment situations. Since the start of the operation, NORAIS has worked as expected, and been operational for over 213 weeks, with only 5 weeks of downtime due to experimentations and other external factors. Several enhancements are made to NORAIS 2, most important is the signal processing and sensitivity in the receiver. The original NORAIS receiver with its reconfigurable software defined radio architecture has been a perfect platform for KONGSBERG to demonstrate continuous in orbit improvements. Via in-orbit upgrades, 
KONGSBERG and FFI have gained an impressive increase in global vessel detection, and as an example more than doubled the detection percentage in the Mediterranean Sea. NORAIS 2, with its enhancements, 
will improve this even further. ""NORAIS 2 is KONGSBERG's third generation SAT-AIS receiver and contains new hardware featuring large mass memory for digital sampling, higher sensitivity and better robustness against interferers"", 
says Frode Storesund, Project manager, Kongsberg Seatex AS. ""The digital platform is optimized for maximizing signal processing capabilities at low power and miniaturized size. This facilitates highly 
advanced algorithm capabilities which are prerequisite for a next generation SAT-AIS receiver."" ""Together with the Norwegian satellites AISSat-1 and AISSat-2 the deployment of the NORAIS 2 demonstrate a leading range of technological solutions for space based AIS"" says Gard Ueland, President 
of Kongsberg Seatex AS. ""We are proud to once again have the opportunity to provide our cutting edge technology to such a prestigious project, a technology that also benefits our customers in a wide range 
of products in our more traditional, maritime markets.""

for oil record and garbage record logbooks. The approval states that K-Fleet Logbook may now be used to fulfil the requirements of the Marshall Islands Maritime Regulations (Marine Notice No. 7-041-5) 
to maintain a deck and navigation log, an engine room log, an oil record book, cargo record book, a garbage record book and a radio log. As part of the K-Fleet suite of Marine Fleet Management Software, K-Fleet Logbook is a secure, modular solution for digital reporting under IMO, Marpol, SOLAS and flag state requirements. The system 
collects data from ship systems into central data storage manually or automatically, and supports event based recording of data related to navigation, engine, oil record book, garbage handling, port calls 
and other operational activities. By enabling automated and electronic data entry using K-Fleet Logbook, daily reporting tasks become less time consuming, reducing workload for officers to focus on operational 
tasks. ""Many shipping companies are in the process of digitalising operations so this acceptance is highly important to us and the 4000 plus vessels registered to the Marshall Islands, who can now record 
more activity through our K-Fleet Logbook solution and integrate it with K-Fleet. We hope that this will catalyse further acceptance in other major flag states, enabling even more ships to meet their 
reporting requirements effectively,"" comments Rune Kr. Stï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lstrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m, Product Manager ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vessel & Fleet Performance, Kongsberg Maritime.

Kongsberg GeoAcoustics contributes to data collection in the aftermath of Tohoku Earthquake,"Kongsberg GeoAcoustics contributes to data collection in the aftermath of Tohoku Earthquake 09 Mar 2012 A Kongsberg GeoAcoustics GeoSwath Plus wide swath system was used to aid the voluntary relief effort in the aftermath of the Tohoku Earthquake which took place in Japan one year ago. Otsuchi harbour, Iwate Prefecture, Japan, before and after the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred one year ago on Friday 11 March 2011. The bathymetry data, acquired with 
Kongsberg GeoAcoustics GeoSwath Plus, show the damage to the infrastructure and large amounts of debris. Data source: Dr. Teruhisa KOMATSU, Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo. Marine technology plays a crucial role in relief, reconstruction and research efforts in the aftermath of this natural disaster. One example are the efforts undertaken by TOYO Corporation who spent 
close to two months surveying affected areas in collaboration with, among others, University of Tokyo and Kumamoto University, using the GeoSwath Plus wide swath system, which was provided free of 
charge by Kongsberg GeoAcoustics. The earthquake , which was one of the most powerful one in human history, occurred 70 km off the coast of Japan. It triggered a tsunami which hit the coast of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima 
prefectures, with wave heights of more than 40 m, travelling up to 10 km inland with devastating results. It left more than 20,000 people dead or missing and Japan is still struggling with its nuclear 
after effects and reconstruction efforts. About the GeoSwath Plus shallow water multibeam echosounder GeoAcoustics GeoSwath Plus offers very efficient simultaneous swath bathymetry and side scan seabed mapping with accuracies that have been shown to exceed the IHO Standards for Hydrographic Surveys. The applied phase measuring 
bathymetric sonar technology provides data coverage of up to 12 times the water depth, giving unsurpassed survey efficiency in shallow water environments. The same area can be mapped 30% to 40% faster using GeoSwath Plus 
than with a typical beamforming echosounder. Contact information Contact details for further information and image requests: Martin Gutowski, Product Sales Manager, Kongsberg GeoAcoustics, Great Yarmouth, UK

KONGSBERG Highlights Data Delivery from Seabed to Shore at Oceanology International North America,"KONGSBERG Highlights Data Delivery from Seabed to Shore at Oceanology International North America 14 Feb 2017 Global marine technology developer brings extensive portfolio to new exhibition and conference in San Diego, California Market leading technology designed for high quality collection and delivery of data for ocean science and commercial operations Kongsberg Maritime will focus on its systems for delivering data from the seabed to the office at the first ever Oceanology International North America (OINA 2017) conference and exhibition 
in San Diego, California this week (February 14-16). The KONGSBERG developed systems on display represent the breadth of Kongsberg Maritime's portfolio for the ocean science and commercial industries, 
with solutions for accurate, high quality data collection through to fast, efficient and effective data communication. The world famous marine technology developer's OINA 2017 exhibition booth (C31/33) will play host to a number of advanced solutions, including the unique Maritime Broadband Radio (MBR) data communication 
system, K-Lander modular seabed sensor carrier, EM 2040P multibeam echo sounder, Seaglider AUV and Seapath 130 heading, attitude and position sensor. Defined as a cutting-edge solution for Environmental Monitoring, Offshore Oil & Gas, Marine Renewables and Marine Research applications, K-Lander is expected to be a technology highlight at OINA 2017. 
With a unique building block concept, K-Lander can be customised for a variety of long-term deployments. The modular design, coupled with a self-floating buoyancy based recovery system, allows for easy 
integration and recovery of various sensors suited for diverse subsea monitoring applications. While K-Lander is designed for stationary installation on the seabed, KONGSBERG's Seaglider AUV is a mobile platform for long-term measurement of oceanographic parameters. Rather than an electrically 
driven propeller, Seaglider uses small changes in buoyancy and wings to achieve forward motion. The system's pitch and roll are controlled using adjustable ballast (the vehicle battery). The compact, portable EM 2040P is KONGSBERG's newest in the series of advanced shallow water multibeam echo sounders. Like all KONGSBERG multibeam echo sounders, motion, position and sound velocity 
measurements are used to compensate for dynamic environmental and platform effects as the data is acquired. The system employs advanced bottom tracking and extra detection, mitigating the need for data 
cleaning. KONGSBERG's Seapath portfolio of heading, attitude and position sensors ensure precision survey with the EM family of echo sounders in addition to numerous third party instruments. The Seapath 130 
series on show at OINA 2017 is developed specifically for hydrographic surveying where high precision heading, position, roll, pitch, heave and timing are critical measurements. It combines state-of-the-art 
dual frequency GNSS receivers, inertial technology and processing algorithms in a compact and portable package that complements the portable nature of the EM 2040P perfectly. Linking the data collected via KONGSBERG subsea sensors, instruments and vehicles, the new MBR delivers interconnectivity between vessels for any maritime operation. IP connectivity secures seamless 
exchange and sharing of data between assets with low latency, as well as possibilities to stream live HD video and voice without any further conventional infrastructure. Easily deployable units create 
a unique solution for the maritime information highway. In addition to its presence on the exhibition floor, KONGSBERG will also present a number of papers and take part in various panel sessions during the OINA 2017 conference, including the Sensors & 
Instrumentation - Approaches & Technologies to Improve Sensor Capacity for Autonomous Measurement Platforms, and Unmanned Vehicles & Vessels - Unmanned Surface Vehicles sessions.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2017/kongsberg-highlights-data-delivery-from-seabed-to-shore-at-oceanology/
"State-of-the-Art KONGSBERG Motion Compensated, Integrated 'Walk-to-Work' System to be installed on Olympic Orion MPSV","State-of-the-Art KONGSBERG Motion Compensated, Integrated 'Walk-to-Work' System to be installed on Olympic Orion MPSV 14 Feb 2017 Integrated solution to provide safe, energy efficient transfer of personnel and materials between vessel and offshore wind turbines Contract includes integration with Kongsberg Information Management System (K-IMS) and upgrade of K-Pos DP software Olympic Shipping has chosen Kongsberg Maritime's new K-Walk integrated vessel gangway solution for installation aboard the Multipurpose Offshore Vessel (MPSV), Olympic Orion. Designed 
to significantly increase efficiency and safety for Walk-to-Work duties, K-Walk will be integrated with the advanced Kongsberg Information Management System (K-IMS) and the existing K-Pos Dynamic Positioning 
system on board Olympic Orion, which will be upgraded as part of the installation in the latter half of 2017. Olympic Orion will utilise the innovative K-Walk solution following its launch as part of KONGSBERG's new Integration Strategy in Fall 2016. The system takes a new approach to increasing productivity 
and efficiency for Walk-to-Work vessels by improving operability of key systems on board. In addition to full integration with K-IMS to enable mission and route planning for increased service capability 
within a wind farm, the system interconnects with the DP and a planning station. The system extends vessel availability by increasing the operational weather window. Through integrated mission planning, automated vessel manoeuvring and gangway hook-up, K-Walk introduces a step-change for increasing efficiency and productivity of the Walk-to-Work operations that 
are integral to Wind Farm Construction and Maintenance projects. While providing a completely safe, motion compensated gangway for the fast transfer of personnel and materials, integration enables more 
efficient approach and settlement at wind turbines and more effective logistics. The system is activated prior to entering a wind turbine's safety zone, reducing vessel speed and launching the K-Walk 
hook up process during approach. Because of the integration with the DP, the gangway is able to move into position while the vessel is still moving, positioning it safely as the vessel arrives on station. The integration of K-Walk with K-IMS is a unique approach that enables in-depth mission planning, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency by finding the most preferred route for increased 
service capability within the wind farm. The system will be fully connected with Olympic Orion's DP system, offering increased operability with a new condition based operator environment, which requires 
less manpower and has minimal training requirements. The K-Walk solution for Olympic Orion will also improve time for mobility and safety with an integrated lift system for transfer of people and goods, 
including electric trolleys (under design) for movement of pallets across the gangway. Overall, K-Walk significantly enhances operational time efficiency, which improves productivity with the ability 
to serve more wind turbines within the same time frame. ""We are very satisfied to select Kongsberg Maritime's new fully integrated Gangway solution for our MPSV Olympic Orion,"" says Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rn Kvalsund, COO, ""We also see a potential to install 
this integrated Gangway solution on board several of our existing vessels in order to provide W2W services into an expanding and interesting market segment."" ""Olympic Orion embodies the future that we envisioned with the launch of our Integration Strategy last year and we are delighted to work with Olympic Shipping for our cutting-edge new K-Walk solution,"" said Stene Fï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rsund, Executive Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing, Kong""K-Walk provides Olympic Orion with total oversight of route planning and gangway hook-up operations. It enables 
better real-time and long-term management decisions, and empowers safer, more predictable, and efficient operations through reduced human interaction and automation based on the deep integration of critical 
systems on board.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2017/state-of-the-art-kongsberg-motion-compensated-integrated-walk-to-work-system/

New LNG Membrane Tanker Cargo Handling Simulator,"New LNG Membrane Tanker Cargo Handling Simulator 22 May 2006 Kongsberg Maritime has developed a new LNG Cargo Handling Simulator, designed 
to assist the safe, efficient and profitable transportation of LNG, through detailed 
and realistic training scenarios. Spherical and Membrane type Membrane type LNG tanker The requirement for the training of crew aboard both existing and new LNG vessels 
of both Spherical and Membrane type continues on its steep upwards curve. Assuming 
all planned production projects start on time the demand for new vessels will reach 
between 200 and 210 by the end of 2010. At its peak we are talking about 85 new 
ships a year. This will create major challenges for the training of such a volume 
of crew in a limited time, which is further compounded by the complexity of the 
LNG operations. Safe, efficient and profitable transportation of LNG depends on 
these crews being fully versed in these Cargo Handling operations. Basic and advanced training The CHS-LNG-M is ideally suited for the training of junior officers in basic 
cargo operations and senior officers in complicated full-scale cargo operations 
(loading/discharging/cooling down/venting). It is a high-fidelity real-time model 
designed to train crews to the highest standard, ensuring operational safety and 
efficiency. All aspects of the cargo handling Our new LNG Cargo Handling Simulator is designed to assist the safe, 
		efficient and profitable transportation of LNG The CHS-LNG M is based on the latest LNG vessels, and the model consists of four 
Technigaz and Gaztransport design membrane tanks able to take fully refrigerated 
cargoes. It uses real-time utilizing an extremely sophisticated mathematical gas 
model comprising components of Methane, Ethane, Propane and Butane as in real life. 
The model is capable of simulating boil-off rates, over pressure and cooling: All 
aspects of the cargo handling procedure that can cause massive damage to tanks or 
hull structure if operated incorrectly. The sophisticated technical design of the simulation is presented as close to 
real-life as possible. In addition to this, the CHS benefits from superlative pedagogical 
processes, providing the best learning experience for students. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½E-Coachï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ system At the core is an advanced 'E-Coach' system, which automatically provides advice 
and feedback on student actions during exercises. This enables Self Paced training 
modules (web or classroom based), providing greater flexibility for both student 
and teacher. On a larger scale, a high number of student stations can be connected to a single 
instructor station and an extremely user-friendly interface helps the instructor 
to define which information is available to the students. This assists instructors 
in planning and structuring lessons to gain the most out of the CHS-LNG-M according 
to time schedules. User-friendly instructor and assessment system Instructors have a flexible array of tools at their disposal, which can be used 
to inject diffe structured teaching 
plan. Decision making experience and skills are high priorities when handling complex 
LNG operations and the CHS-LNG-M Membrane supports training in these essential skills, 
having the capability to provide an extensive number of potential malfunctions and 
alarm conditions. This flexibility together with the Very High Fidelity models displaying 
numerous variables and information on screen form the basis for this essential part 
of the training. A user-friendly instructor and assessment system enables results 
to be collated in an efficient manner to provide accurate progress reporting. The combination of sophisticated technical models to simulate the vessel and 
powerful tools for instructors to provide the 'lesson' are the key features that 
enable CHS-LNG-M to train students for safe, efficient and profitable transportation 
of LNG.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2006/new-lng-membrane-tanker-cargo-handling-simulator/

Kongsberg Maritime in Horten has signed a contract that will make the school far 
more than a bridgehead in maritime education, It will also provide anchorage for 
close cooperation between education and industry. One of the Hurtigruten Group high speed vessels. The Hurtigruten Group has signed a contract with Bodin Upper Secondary School 
to rent simulator hours valued at 1 million Norwegian Crowns per year for the next 
five years. ""That called for us to hoist the flag"", smiles Rector Brynjulf Kildal 
at the school. Breaker waves The new bridge simulator will cost 12.3 million Norwegian Crowns to put in place. 
It has taken four years to reach this point, but we rode a few breaker waves and 
had to implement a modicum of dynamic positioning, but now the time has come to 
plough ahead with this exciting project. Bodin Upper Secondary is a maritime technical school. The simulator equipment 
it has today originated in 1984 and 1991, meaning it is outmoded and impractical 
to run. It has been remarked that it also occasionally requires a hair dryer to 
get it started, so its about time a new simulator was installed! ""It simply isn't up to today's standards. We have already noticed that students 
apply to other schools to avoid dealing with our equipment. However, as from January, 
we will be the ones setting the standard. I couldn't be happier about that,"" adds 
the Rector. Norway's most modern simulated conning bridge will be an exact replica of the 
bridge on the Hurtigruten Group's high-speed vessels. Visually, the simulator will 
represent three vessels, 12 PC-based solutions and five authentic bodies of water. Major contract ""This is a major contract for us as well. Our orders for simulator solutions 
usually amount to about MNOK 6, although we have also delivered total packages valued 
at more than 100 million Norwegian Crowns to the international market,"" comments 
Runar Pedersen of Kongsberg Maritime. There are two versions of the simulator: A high-speed vessel bridge with a 225-degree continuous field of vision. Conventional bridges for general navigation training and bridge duty with a 120-degree field of vision. ""The simulators are not hydraulic, but that is not necessary for creating a feeling 
of authenticity. Visual impressions and sounds make you feel as though you are at 
sea, even though you're sitting in the classroom. The systems offer more than enough 
to make you seasick,"" promises Pedersen. Initially, there will be two high-speed vessel models and two ferry solutions

The objective of the course is to show the generic characteristics of piracy to give ship-owners, captains and crews tools for a tactical approach to sailing through piracy waters. Somali pirates in small boats were able to hijack the MV Faina, a Belize flagged cargo ship owned and operated by 'Kaalbye Shipping Ukraine'. The ship is carrying a cargo of Ukrainian T-72 tanks and related equipment. It had no on board security when it was attacked on Sept. 28 and was forced to proceed to an anchorage off the Somali Coast. Photo Courtesy of U.S. Navy. The anti piracy training is based on research and knowledge of the company Risk Intelligence, providing intelligence on pirates' behaviour, strengths and weaknesses, risk analyses and recommended lines of defence/actions. ""Once the crew know how to react the simulator is an excellent tool to practice drills to secure the crew's safety, communicate with the international naval forces and other evasive and defensive measures"" says Bjorn Kay at Marstal Navigation School. 70 methods to avoid pirate attacks According to Bjorn Kay there are up to 70 different methods to avoid pirates from boarding the vessel, none of which involve armed security staff on board. ""Our opinion is that simulators can be used for research to qualify standards and best practices,"" he says. The use of simulators The simulator training is set up with merchant ships as 'own ships' and attack vessels (skiffs, dhows, etc) as 'target ships', using the facilities of the KONGSBERG Ship's Bridge Simulator to define parameters such as weather, wind conditions, sea state and different attack patterns. The use of functionalities in the simulator like AIS/ECDIS and communication systems are essential to perform a good training scenario. Identifying suspect vessels The Bridge watch/crew/lookout and procedures are included in the training course, with particular emphasis on differentiating between normal and suspect activities typical for the sailing area. ""The lookout has access to systems like AIS, ECDIS/maps, radar and news and information provided by the international naval coalition, but the visual bridge watch is equally important"" claims Kay. ""In Somalia for example, suspect vessels to pay attention to are small fast craft, fishing vessels, and dhows with a lot of crew or towing 2-3 smaller vessels. Here vessels to be monitored closely on the radar are e.g. ships that behave in an irregular, fashion, laying still close to transit corridors, where there is no reason to anchor or fish and one should also keep a close watch on vessels not sending AIS signals"". Psychological focus Another important part of the training at Marstal will be the psychological aspects before and after the attack. At the end of a training session, the school will put emphasis on analysing the exercise in a debrief session. Transferable knowledge ""The principles behind the training can also be used to train navy vessels patrolling the waters by offering structured information about pirate modus operandi and behaviour from the area, thereby making the military presence more efficient and offering better protections for the merchant fleet"" concludes Bjorn Kay.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2009/simulator-qualifies-best-practice-to-handle-piracy-attack/

KONGSBERG's new 'Clariscan' high performance domed scanning sonar ready for delivery,"KONGSBERG's new 'Clariscan' high performance domed scanning sonar ready for delivery Following introductions this year at Subsea Expo in January, Underwater Intervention in February and Oceanology International in March, KONGSBERG's state-of-the-art Clariscan Domed 
Scanning Sonar is now available. Clariscan combines wide bandwidth composite transducer technology developed by Kongsberg Maritime's Canadian subsidiary Kongsberg Mesotech, with a patented acoustic lens 
to provide exceptional image quality. This innovative new sonar offers the same protective attributes of standard domed transducers without the traditional loss in performance and image clarity. 07 Jul 2016 ""We are very pleased to introduce Clariscan technology to our product line,"" says Daryl Morse, Sales Manager at Kongsberg Mesotech. ""Our 1171 4000 m depth-rated sonar already performed very well with 
the monolithic transducer, but with the addition of the wide-bandwidth composite transducer and acoustic lens, the image quality is exceptional. The acoustic lens is one of the most significant enhancements 
in the history of scanning sonar. It's a game-changer."" Domed sonars were introduced in the 1990s using enclosed transducers in an oil-filled dome to provide mechanical protection and eliminate flooding due to O-ring failure on the exposed transducer shaft. 
While the oil-filled dome solved the O-ring flooding failures, it introduced beam defocusing in two conditions, warm & shallow and cold & deep. The beam defocusing effect reduces clarity of the images 
produced and becomes more extreme in cold deep water as depth increases. Until now, there has been no solution to this problem, aside from using a high-resolution scanning sonar head. KONGSBERG engineers have solved this problem by designing a patented acoustic lens that maintains beam focus through the entire operational temperature and depth range, significantly improving sonar 
performance and resulting in images that are much sharper. The Clariscan acoustic lens behaves like an optical contact lens, correcting the refraction caused by the oil in the dome. This image acquired with Clariscan is clearer and more detailed than a standard domed scanning sonar - see image below. This image was acquired with a standard domed scanning sonar and shows less detail. Deep water testing in the Gulf of Mexico has shown the clarity of images produced by the Clariscan compared to a standard 1171 domed sonar with composite transducer (see accompanying images). The two 
sonar heads were mounted side by side on the ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) and thus exposed to the same temperature, pressure and salinity conditions, and were operated simultaneously during image capture. 
The image quality of the Clariscan sonar unit is clearly superior, rivalling a high-resolution scanning sonar head. KONGSBERG is taking orders of the Clariscan Domed Scanning Sonar and the new units are going into production effective immediately.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/kongsbergs-new-clariscan-high-performance-domed-scanning-sonar-ready-for/
HUGIN AUV used in search for Amundsen's airplane,"HUGIN AUV used in search for Amundsen's airplane 25 Feb 2009 When the royal Norwegian Navy in August starts its search for Roald Amundsen's airplane Latham, which disappeared in the Barents Sea in 1928, the HUGIN 1000 MR autonomous underwater vehicle will play a vital role. The Royal Norwegian Navy will start the search in August 2009 based on directions given by the Norwegian Aviation Museum. They will explore an area close to Bear Island - the southernmost island of the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago, where the plane is assumed to have gone down and where local fishermen might previously have found parts of the airplane. The HUGIN 1000 MR will be an important tool which the navy will operate from their logistic vessel KNM Tyr. ""HUGIN 1000 MR is the main search tool for this job. Covering 34 square nautical miles is not possible with a camera so we are very lucky to have this instrument. HUGIN 1000 MR is a state-of-the-art AUV with the capacity to go down to 1000 metres and an operational speed of 4 knots. We can have this out at sea for 18 hours continually. If the plane is there, we are confident that we will find it,"" explained Captain Lieutenant Helge Stian Telle of the Royal Norwegian Navy. Vice President of AUVs for Kongsberg Maritime, Mr. Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rn Jalving is positive that HUGIN 1000 MR an ideal tool in the search for Latham, given its new and advanced technologica""We are proud to support this project. The HUGIN 1000 AUV with the HISAS 1030 synthetic aperture sonar has a new level of resolution and range in acoustic imagery and is especially designed to find small, modern mines, efficiently searching large areas. It is therefore very well suited for finding the Latham airplane. Its advanced navigation system counters the fact that GPS does no work under water. Consequently, if the airplane is found, its position will be well known,"" commented Vice President AUV for Kongsberg Maritime, Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rn Jalving. An historical dream 75 years after Amundsen vanished on his mission to save the Italian general and aviation engineer Umberto Nobile, the Norwegian Aviation Museum decided to reinvestigate the disappearance. A search was carried out in 2004, but had to be called off due to bad weather. Since then, the Norwegian Aviation Museum has fought a battle to reopen the search for Latham, together with the Royal Norwegian Navy and Context TV, a Berlin-based production company specialising in documentaries related to scientific-historical expeditions and explorations with main emphasis on the underwater segment. Context TV has shown an interest in the project from the beginning. They have conducted extensive research on the disappearance of Latham and will document the search. When the search reopens later this year, all parties are well prepared with better equipment""Our historical dream is about to come true during this search for Amundsen and this is made possible thanks to Context-TV, Kongsberg Maritime and the Norwegian Navy,"" said Navigator Per Arvid Tellermann from the Norwegian Aviation Museum.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2009/hugin-auv-used-in-search-for-amundsens-airplane/

Significant dynamic positioning in ice research project gets green light,"Significant dynamic positioning in ice research project gets green light 28 Jun 2012 Kongsberg Maritime DP and simulation systems provide foundation for improving ice operations The final piece of a CAD $8.5 million research project to improve DP operations in ice fell into place on May 23, 2012 when the Government of Canada announced a contribution of $3.2 million 
to the project from the Atlantic Innovation Fund, administered by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.

Christopher Hearn. ""Dynamic Positioning Operations in Ice Environments"" project is a five-year initiativeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ involving multiple collaborators and stakeholders.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Photo courtesy: Angie Bishop, MI. Led by long-time Kongsberg Maritime simulator customer CMS ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the Centre for Marine Simulation (Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University), the five-year research project aims to improve 
the safety and efficiency of oil and gas operations in ice environments by improving dynamic positioning (DP) system technologies for operations in ice. Central to the collaboration is the National Research Council of Canada's Ocean, Coastal and River Engineering facilities in St. John's, Newfoundland. Principal study investigator, Dr. Jim Millan, 
is well known internationally for his team's work with DP and hull-ice interaction, both of which have paved the way ahead for the current project. As resource exploration continues to grow in northern latitudes, increasing demand will be placed on technology to ensure safety and efficiency challenges in terms of the remoteness of the area, the vast distances, the scarcity and cost of support logistics and the risk to the environment. The possibility to extend offshore drilling and production 
seasons in ice-infested waters is therefore of significant interest to the oil and gas industry. Kongsberg Maritime will be the commercialisation partner in the project. In addition to providing DP equipment, engineering services and a financial contribution to the research team, KONGSBERG remains 
optimistic the research findings will ultimately result in the development and commercialisation of a specialised DP system module specifically for ice operations that can be provided as an option to 
the company's current and future generations of DP technology. Simulation testing is central to the research, whereby new algorithms developed as a result of discoveries from ice tank testing will be first tested in the Kongsberg Maritime DP simulator. Simulation 
testing will also play a key role in assessing the limiting weather criteria for safe DP operations in ice and the development of new recommended guidelines for the same. A full suite of new CMS 'DP-in-Ice' 
simulation training courses are also expected to flow from the project. CMS is a Nautical Institute-certified DP training site currently equipped with the latest Konsgberg Maritime DP simulator technology (based on KONGSBERG K-Pos DP systems) and managed by highly experienced 
DP instructional staff. Of particular interest to the Centre is the ability to better analyse vessel capability and the limitations associated with positioning in ice infested environments. ""Controlled movement is vital for the safety of personnel and the environment. DP systems on the market today are not optimised to fully account for the forces and movements that exist in ice environments 
and it is these input variables that need to be understood for effective and reliable arctic DP operations,"" commented CMS Director Christopher Hearn.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2012/significant-dynamic-positioning-in-ice-research-project-gets-green-light/

Currently under construction at the Heesen shipyard in Oss, Netherlands, Skyfall is the most powerful yacht the yard has built to date. 09 Mar 2021 The use of waterjets on Skyfall reduces vibration by up to 40% compared with a conventional shaft drive, and has allowed the 60m yacht to be designed with a draught of less than three metres ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ impossible with propellers, which would have required diameters exceeding this figure to absorb the available horsepower. Tommi Viiperi, General Manager, Sales ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ EMEA, Kongsberg Maritime, explains: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Our type S90-4 waterjets offer the best efficiency and durability on the market thanks to their innova. Their compact reversing buckets and steering nozzles enable superior position keeping and manoeuvrability at both high and low speeds. These advantages, combined with low vibration levels and extremely shallow draught, make our waterjets an attractive concept for superyacht propulsion, enabling owners to benefit from comfort, safety and reliable operation.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Waterjets also have the benefit of eliminating shaft and propeller noise and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ because they avoid the varying torques associated with propellers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ there is no risk of overloading the engines, lengthening their life. On board Skyfall , the four S90-4 steel series waterjets will be teamed with four engines delivering a total of 22,000 horsepower. The outer engines will drive steerable and reversible jets, while the centre engines will operate as booster units. The fully-featured control system supplied by Kongsberg Maritime will use the latest technology, including joystick contrensor and gyro, the automatic positioning system compensates for wind and current, allowing the vessel to maintain both position and heading using the installed propulsion systems. All parameters are manually adjustable via touch screens. Skyfall features a lightweight aluminium Fast Displacement Hull Form (FDHF) that Heesen claims will result in an almost flat ride at speeds exceeding 30 knots. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We did a lot of calculations and discovered that we could achieve the required speed with this horsepower and these dimensions with either a semi-displacement or a fast displacement hull form, which will be much more comfortable,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ explains Heesenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s General Manager of Design and Development, Peter van der Zanden. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rather than raising the bow out of the water to reach high speeds, this hull will run nearly flat, no more than a 10-degree angle versus 35 degrees for the semi-displacement form at top speed.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½r-based Omega Architects and with an interior by British studio Harrison Eidsgaard, Skyfall is tailored to reflect the ownerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s joint passions: speed, as demonstrated by her powerful waterjet drive system; and fishing, catered for with a huge ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½fishing caveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ with stowage for 40 rods.

Acergy buys KONGSBERG HAIN systems,"Acergy buys KONGSBERG HAIN systems Acergy Northern Europe and Canada Survey Business Unit has purchased two KONGSBERG HAIN subsea positioning reference systems. The systems are due for delivery in late March for initial use on a key project for a major oil company in Norway. 23 Mar 2006 Reduce cost and operational risk The HAIN (Hydro-acoustic Aided Inertial Navigation) system, a combination of KONGSBERG 's HiPAP precise acoustic positioning and INS (Inertial Navigation System) technologies, is a proven valuable tool in the fight to reduce cost and operation risk in deepwater field developments and construction projects. Accuracy can be improved by up to 300% In the combined operation of HAIN Subsea & HiPAP systems, the overall deepwater positioning accuracy can be improved by up to 300% in USBL mode. Subsequently, more subsea work can be completed using this positioning mode, without the time consuming need to deploy (and retrieve) large numbers of LBL transponders and frames. This means less subsea assets to be capitalised, maintained and managed, while further reducing the unit failure risk. Lower risk of vehicle failure ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ROV pilots have found the HAIN USBL position plots much more reliable, so aiding navigation and speeding up the vehicle's work rate. Less time in the water means a lower risk of vehicle failure, thus allowing more time on deck for operational maintenance, minimising the chance of future costly downtime,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ comments Iain Fullerton, Kongsberg Maritime. Committed to using the latest technology ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Acergy is committed to using the latest technology combined with our existing assets to ensure efficient survey operations. Using HAIN, we are confident that the survey work we carry out at major oil fields will be more time and cost effective, due to the greater positioning accuracy of the HAIN system,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says John Meaden, Survey Manager, Northern Europe and Canada. Significant operational advantages HAIN perators have been able to realise significant operational advantages using the HiPAP / HAIN combination. These operators have been able to maximise the use of their existing assets while being able to reduce operational vessel time and subsea hardware while improving ROV positioning repeatability & accuracy.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2006/acergy-buys-kongsberg-hain-systems/

Geoconsult buys second inertial navigation system,"Geoconsult buys second inertial navigation system 29 Mar 2005 To satisfy the positioning requirements from Hydro on the Ormen Lange gas field, 
Geoconsult AS has bought its second Hydroacoustic Aided Inertial Navigation system 
(HAIN). Hydro has demanding requirements for accurate positioning at the Ormen Lange 
field, which is one of the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s harshest deepwater seabed environments. In a 
gas production area with an extensive amount of seabed transport pipes, HAIN is 
a vital tool for improving underwater positioning. Geoconsultï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Business Development 
Manager Arvid Pettersen reports that the impressive experience with the first system 
made the investment decision easy for this second system. The HAIN combines the Acoustic and Inertial positioning principles; which is 
ideal since they have complementary qualities. Acoustic positioning is characterized 
by relatively high and evenly distributed noise and no drift in the position, whilst 
inertial positioy large drift in 
the position over time. The HAIN Subsea system solution is used for providing underwater vehicles with 
three times improved acoustic position accuracy and will also provide a higher position 
update rate.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2005/geoconsult-buys-second-inertial-navigation-system/

Royal Norwegian Navy orders second HUGIN 1000 AUV,"Royal Norwegian Navy orders second HUGIN 1000 AUV The Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN) is following up the successful first phase of the Norwegian Mine Reconnaissance Program (HUGIN MRS) by placing an order with KONGSBERG for another HUGIN 1000 autonomous under water vehicle - AUV. 17 Jun 2005 Successful in military operations The HUGIN MRS Program is being developed in several phases with technology, concept development and field evaluations in progress since 1998. This stage of the program included a number of HUGIN operations by the RNoN throughout 2002 and 2003, mobilising one of the existing HUGIN AUVs onboard the Norwegian mine hunter HNoMS Karmoey. These operations resulted in successful demonstrations of the HUGIN AUV in military operations. Successfully deployed in several NATO exercises The RNoN placed an order for the first HUGIN 1000, a dedicated AUV for military operation, early in 2004. HUGIN 1000 is operated from the RNoN mine hunter, HNoMS Karmoey, and has been successfully deployed in several NATO exercises and in NATO's Immediate Reaction Force MCMFORNORTH(1) from autumn 2004. Various types of operations have been performed, ranging from route surveys to covert mine reconnaissance and Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) missions. High quality, high resolution imagery Equipped with side scan or synthetic aperture sonar, multibeam echo sounder, and a state of the art integrated inertial navigation system, HUGIN AUVs provide high quality, high resolution imagery and bathymetry with excellent position accuracy. A proven launch and recovery system allows safe and efficient operation in high sea states. The next HUGIN 1000 for the RnoN will be equipped with the HISAS 1030, a high resolution Interferrometric Synthetic Aperture Sonar developed in co-operation between Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) and KONGSBERG. The vehicle endurance will also be extended by adding more modules of the pressure tolerant Lithium Polymer battery developed for the first HUGIN 1000 AUV. Improvements in military requirements and vehicle operation will be included, based on the RnoN's extensive field experience with the existing HUGIN 1000 AUV. Both civilian and military application The HUGIN AUVs have been developed in a dual civilian/military effort. In the civilian market the HUGIN 3000 is now established as the industry standard for AUV offshore surveying and is the only AUV that can run for 2.5 days at water depths down to 3000 meters, whilst operating multibeam echo sounder, side scan sonar and sub-bottom profiler.

The 'Resurrection' of an East Indiaman,"The 'Resurrection' of an East Indiaman 03 Jun 2005 The air reeks of tar, turpentine and linseed oil. Eighty people are working away frantically on deck. You can almost envisage what life at sea must have been like in the 18th century on board the East Indiaman whose replica so accurately reflects the golden age of sailing. Mind you, the new vessel hides a secret or two, which may explain the difference between being an 'exact' replica and a 'perfect' replica. For example, the entire lower deck of the replica is crammed with state-of-the-art machinery and technology. We called on this graceful vessel just a few weeks before she was scheduled for her maiden test voyage. As is the case on most construction sites just prior to delivery, the vessel was a showcase of goal-oriented chaos. People were working high and low. Equipment and materials were all over the place. Chief Engineer Sture Arvidsson was nonetheless calm and optimistic, assuring us that the vessel will be accorded the respect and pride she deserves when she sets out on her great voyage to China. The ship has a fascinating history. In the 18th century, Sweden's commercial and maritime activities were heavily reliant on the Asian trade. Long voyages on the high seas were a risky business, with lives and formidable treasures at the mercy of the whims of Mother Nature. Indeed, the original vessel met her destiny when she foundered on a rock and sank to the bottom of the sea in the very entrance to her home port of Gothenburg, Sweden. The vessel's tragic fate was forgotten for a long, long time, until a diver rediscovered the wreck in 1984. ""Someone came up with the crazy notion of building a full-scale replica of the vessel, but I don't think they had any idea what they were in for!"" laughs Arvidsson in retrospect. However, those first enthusiasts must have been convincing, because they had no trouble finding sponsors and partners. Roughly 350 million Swedish Crowns were collected, and sponsors and partners have donated equipment and specialist work worth who knows how much. The idea was to reconstruct the ship and make her into a proud symbol of Sweden's international trade, industry and culture. The propulsion system ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a challe""The greatest challenge we've faced has been to find technical solutions that meet the current requirements of the international maritime authorities, while retaining the classic historical appearance of the East Indiaman"", Arvidsson points out. ""Naturally, the vessel also has to meet today's standards for health, safety and the environment, areas where the world has, in fact, made a wee bit of progress since the original vessel was sailing. Today's requirements and standards have been quite difficult to combine with the desire to retain the vessel's carvel construction, but we have generally managed to find solutions that satisfy all parties. In consequence, however, most of the vessel's technical equipment has been placed deep down in the vessel, along with a full-scale, modern engine room. While the vessel is an exact replica of the original on the outside, her 'innards' contain the very latest technology. ""The vessel is equipped with five waterproof bulkheads. They are intended to optimise safety at sea, but presented challenges in terms of where cables and pipes were to be placed"", smiles Arvidsson. ""Despite the vessel's space constraints, she is now equipped with systems comparable to those on major merchant vessels."" Arvidsson discloses that the engine alone has required 80 000 hours of work by the shipyard personnel. He has no idea how much time the various equipment suppliers have invested. The three main engines have an output of 100 HP at 'all ahead full', and top speed is eight knots. Power is supplied by two main generators, and the vessel carries a fairly heavy-duty emergency back-up generator. To ensure safety on board, there is a double fire and bilge pump, as well as a fully automatic sprinkler system that remains functional even if the ship's power supply fails. The vessel's engine room is designed to be unmanned for long periods of time. The surveillance and alarm functions are located in the navigation bay, allowing the duty engineer to monitor all relevant readings from there. ""The team that has worked together to accomplish all this has been absolutely amazing"", continues Arvidsson. ""Specialists, boat buffs and idealistically-inclined pensioners have worked side by side. The quality of their craftsmanship is exceptional. Being allowed to help re-create this vessel is a dream come true for many of them, like winning the jackpot in some huge lottery. I believe I speak for many people, when I say that it will be a thrill to see the vessel set sail, and know that I helped it happen"", concludes Arvidsson, who is busy putting the final touches on the replica of Sweden's proud vintage flagship. KONGSBERG ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ official sponsor of the Swedish East Indiaman Building one of the world's largest wooden sailing ships in modern time calls for tremendous resources in terms of materials, funding and personnel. This project could never have been undertaken, let alone completed, without generous support from 'outsiders'. This help included materials for the ship, support from local, regional and national authorities, and financial support. KONGSBERG has provided a DataChief C20 alarm monitoring and control system equipped with operator stations both in the engine room and the navigation bay.

Kongsberg Maritime HAIN Reference System number 50 goes to Ocean Rig,"Kongsberg Maritime HAIN Reference System number 50 goes to Ocean Rig Kongsberg Maritime has delivered its 50th HAIN (Hydro Acoustic aided Inertial Navigation) Reference System, to long-time HAIN user, Ocean Rig. HAIN significantly improves reference data accuracy and update rate sent to Dynamic Positioning (DP) systems to support safer, more reliable and efficient offshore drilling operation. It is also suitable for applications including offshore loading and specialist operations such as offshore construction. 24 Feb 2014 HAIN significantly improves reference data accuracy and update rate sent to Dynamic Positioning systems to support safer, more reliable drilling operations. Ocean Rig is an international offshore drilling contractor providing oilfield services for offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production drilling, and specialising in the ultra-deep water and harsh environment segment of the offshore drilling industry. The company was an early adopter of the HAIN Reference system for DP vessels. ""This delivery marks a significant milestone for our acoustic based DP position reference product, which was introduced almost a decade ago,"" says Morten Berntsen, Sales Manager Subsea Underwater Instrumentation, Kongsberg Maritime. ""We have seen a surge in HAIN Reference System sales in the last 4-5 years that corresponds both with the boom in rig new builds and a general acceptance of acoustic aiding of inertial navigation for improving acoustic based reference systems."" HAIN combines hydro acoustic positioning with measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to substantially improve position accuracy compared to using acoustics alone. The addition of HAIN to an acoustic positioning system such as KONGSBERG HiPAP or HPR increases position accuracy by up to 4 times, whilst ensuring a constant 1 Hz update rate. This gives a vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s acoustic positioning system the same weighting as GPS within the DP system. HAIN users also benefit from added robustness, less downtime, and less transponder battery use, all aspects that can increase operational efficiency for offshore vessels. HAIN Reference is primarily installed on drilling rigs and drillships, though Kongsberg Maritime has supplied it for a diverse range of offshore DP vessels including shuttle tankers, pipe layers an""It is quite fitting that the 50th HAIN Reference system was delivered to one of the first companies to embrace HAIN technology.

New multi converters for 2-stroke engine instrumentation,"New multi converters for 2-stroke engine instrumentation 12 Dec 2005 Benefits New multi converters for 2-stroke engine instrumentation KONGSBERG has launched a new series of multi converters for engine mounting. The converters can connect up to 4 sensors and communication is via CAN Open or 4-20 mA. When mounted directly onto a large 2 stroke engine the following benefits are obtained: Reduced cabling on engine Standard length in sensor cables Reduced cabling between engine and engine control room Simple installation, disconnection and service of sensors Reduced need for sensor spares variation Reduce cost Immediate benefits include reduced equipment and installation costs that come from the standardization of sensor cable lengths and the need for less cabling on the engine. Existing concepts call for individual cables to run from each sensor to a main junction box mounted at the end of the engine. By using the new KONGSBERG 
converters a single 6 wire cable can be used if the CAN Open type option is used. The 4-20 mA converters require installation of one cable from each converter to a main junction box, which reduces the need for sensor spares variation and provides simple sensor service. Simplify retrofit installations The concept of engine mounted multi converters makes it simple to perform retrofit installations of Condition Monitoring System. This can be systems for exhaust gas, cylinder liner temperature monitoring or bearing temperature monitoring.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2005/new-multi-converters-for-2-stroke-engine-instrumentation/

KONGSBERG ships seagliders to national oceanography centre,"KONGSBERG ships seagliders to national oceanography centre 29 Apr 2014 The Seaglider is a vital tool in the collection of physical oceanographic data over extended durations and geographic areas. Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. has recently supplied five new Seaglider Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) systems to the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in Southampton, UK. The AUVs were 
ordered by NOC's Marine Autonomous and Robotic Systems facility (MARS), and will become part of a fleet of underwater gliders that are made available to research institutes around the United Kingdom. 
With this delivery, MARS will now have 10 Seagliders in its pool of AUVs. MARS supplies and supports gliders for scientists at the NOC, as well as institutes and Universities around the UK, to carry out their research programmes. 2013 has seen significant investment by the 
UK government in this technology, furnishing the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with a fleet of over 30 gliders. These gliders are being used to support and enhance oceanographic research 
by UK scientists around the world, and the new KONGSBERG Seagliders will see service from home waters to the Antarctic. The new systems will immediately be put to use by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS), which also owns two of its own Seaglider AUVs. All of the vehicles will be used in three ongoing, 
long term research programs: FASTNEt, the Extended Ellet Line and OSNAP. FASTNEt is a four year program to study the ocean/shelf exchange using novel observations and model techniques to resolve the key seasonal, interannual and regional variation absent from existing knowledge. Stretching across the Atlantic Ocean between Scotland and Iceland, the Extended Ellett Line is a major gateway for water exchange between the Nordic seas and the Atlantic. Regular in-situ monitoring 
is essential to develop the understanding of circulation in this area, which has a significant impact in the moderation of Western Europe's climate. OSNAP is an international program started in 2013 and is designed to provide a continuous record of the full-water column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the subpolar North Atlantic. 
It will generate new knowledge and understanding of the gyre's wider impacts on climate and will help improve long term climate predictions and weather forecasting. ""Due to their ability to operate in adverse weather, gliders are an essential component of our strategy for wintertime observations, which, in the past, have been very difficult to achieve. Clearer 
insight into wintertime conditions will shed new light on our understanding of upper ocean variability,"" remarked Dr. Stefan Gary, a research associate at SAMS.

Kongsberg Maritime develops innovative Mooring Capable Solution for Offshore Construction Vessels,"Kongsberg Maritime develops innovative Mooring Capable Solution for Offshore Construction Vessels Kongsberg Maritime has developed an innovative mooring capable solution for Offshore Construction Vessels (OSCVs), expanding the capabilities of OSCVs beyond their current scope to include the pre-lay of mooring lines as a natural extension to original suction anchor capabilities. 13 February 2025 Text: Global Sales and Marketing Photo: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Kongsberg Maritime By integrating a purpose designed anchor handling winch , shark jaws and stern rollers into the design of OSCVs at the newbuild stage, vessel owners can now equip their ships to perform a broader range of mooring operations. This advancement allows OSCVs to handle more tasks independently, filling the shortage of vessels capable of large-scale mooring installations . Key Benefits of the Mooring Capable Solution: Enhanced Operational Window: The new system allows OSCVs to carry out a larger portion of mooring operations, extending their operatioeducing the need for additional vessels at the field. Cost Efficiency: By expanding the operational capabilities of OSCVs, significant synergies can be achieved for the field developer. Safety and Efficiency: The addition of winches and stern rollers enables safer and more efficient over-stern deployment of mooring lines, a method commonly used by AHTS vessels. Flexible Installation Options: The winch can either be permanently installed or portable and loaded on board only when needed. The shark jaws and stern rollers are permanently fitted to the ship. Versatile Equipment: The subsea crane, a common feature of OSCVs, can lift and install suction piles, as well as hold the load of mooring chain. The winch package includes one drum for work wire and two cable lifters for handling chain. In combination with superior DP capabilities and a large deck area that makes for an efficient installation vessel With regards to field development and mooring installation, OSCVs are currently limited to setting large suction piles or driven piles into the seabed using onboard cranes and ROVs, without requiring additional vessel equipment. While some mooring lines can be installed using ad hoc methods, the new solution from Kongsberg Maritime means that OSCVs can perform these tasks safer and more efficiently. There will be a lack of vessels with subsea crane and sufficient deck area suited to support the planned high volume of both large anchors and mooring lines in the years to come. With the addition of this system, OSCVs become a more attractiveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and efficient solution, especially when there is a shortage of specialised mooring installation vessels.

New Kongsberg Maritime and DNV-GL DP operator training scheme enhances competence and reduces time to certification,"New Kongsberg Maritime and DNV-GL DP operator training scheme enhances competence and reduces time to certification Kongsberg Maritime has become the first global maritime training provider to offer a new DNV-GL approved Dynamic Positioning Operator (DPO) training scheme at its training centres worldwide. The brand 
new KONGSBERG Training Scheme for DP Operators is based on a combination of new and established DNV training standards, with the learning process designed by Kongsberg Maritime. 15 Jun 2015 Kongsberg Maritime is the first to offer a new DNV-GL approved Dynamic Positioning Operator training scheme at its training centres worldwide The scheme is a step-change in the critical area of DPO training, with teaching and assessor competence, and the use of advanced simulators forming the platform for training high quality DPOs in a 
significantly reduced timeframe. The KONGSBERG Training Scheme for DP Operators focuses on competence training and competence assessment developed using the latest methods developed in the science of 
education. Instructors will work much closer with individual students throughout the duration of the scheme. After completing the training program students leave with a DP certificate only by passing the mandatory theoretical and practical independent assessment. Implemented to ensure the competence of DPOs 
leaving the course, the exam is a significant change in approach to DPO training, which until now has not featured mandatory examinations and certification. Kongsberg Maritime is approved by DNV-GL as 
the global certification body for the new scheme, which is designed to produce highly qualified and competent DPOs. The first KONGSBERG Training Scheme course for DP Operators starts in August at Kongsberg Maritime's training facility in Kongsberg, Norway. KONGSBERG training centres in Aberdeen, Houston, Rio de 
Janeiro and Singapore will also operate the new scheme. The scheme is based on a three-step program. Step-one is an intensive 10 day course, covering theory and practical elements with significant time spent on Kongsberg Maritime's cutting-edge DP and offshore 
training simulators. After logging the required sea-time with their employer (step-two), course participants will return to the training centre to complete their training (step-three) and take the exam. 
During the whole process, simulator and theoretical exercises will be used to monitor student learning levels. The scheme also features an option to extend to a fourth step, to gain training and certification for specific DP operations. Course participants can select from Offshore Loading, Drilling and Offshore 
Operations extensions, all of which require the DPO to take an application specific exam. Step-four participants will benefit from highly specialised training in theory, and on application specific simulators. ""The current standard DP training regime can take far too long. Considering the demand for quality DPOs is already high and expected to grow further, reducing time spent to certification and enhancing 
the quality of the training is an attractive proposition for offshore operating companies and vessel owners,"" explains ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½yvind Pedersen, Product Advisor, Kongsberg Maritime Global Customer Suppor""With the Kongsberg Training Scheme for DP Operators, employers and participants have a clear schedule of high quality training condensed into a short period, backed up by an exam that ensures competence

New DGPS from Kongsberg Seatex exploits the power of Fugro SeaSTAR SGG,"New DGPS from Kongsberg Seatex exploits the power of Fugro SeaSTAR SGG New DGNSS from Kongsberg Seatex exploits the power of fugro SeaSTAR SGG. 06 Oct 2009 New DGNSS from Kongsberg Seatex exploits the power of fugro SeaSTAR SGG. DPS 110 and DPS 112, have been developed to utilise the Global Satellite Based Augmentation System introduced by the navigation specialist Fugro SeaSTAR AS, the SeaSTAR SGG service. Worldwide sub-metre accuracy is available with the new Fugro SeaSTAR SGG service. Kongsberg Seatex, a specialist in position reference systems, has unveiled the latest additions to its highly regarded DPS (Differential Position Sensor) product portfolio. Two new products, DPS 110 and DPS 112, have been developed to utilise the new Global Satellite Based Augmentation System (Global SBAS) introduced by the navigation specialist Fugro SeaSTAR AS, the SeaSTAR SGG service. This new high performance navigation service offers corrections to both GPS and GLONASS that enables sub-metre accuracy with worldwide reach. Unlike regional SBAS services such as WAAS, EGNOS and MSAS, and local DGPS services such as IALA DGPS, SeaSTAR SGG utilises Fugro's own network of dual system reference stations to calculate 'orbit and clock' corrections. The service provides consistent sub-metre level accuracy positioning with global validity. The DPS 110 and DPS 112 are even capable of supplementing SeaSTAR SGG corrections with regional SBAS and local DGPS corrections. The Kongsberg Seatex DPS product line is well-proven and in use by professional marine and offshore users worldwide. By complementing the DPS product line and introducing the SeaSTAR SGG service, Kongsberg Seatex and Fugro SeaSTAR extend the user segment to new vessel categories. ""Operators have to consider the balance of cost versus operational benefits in choosing a professional DGNSS solution for workboats and platform supply vessels,"" comments Arne Norum, Managing Director of Fugro SeaSTAR. ""SGG gives sub-metre level accuracy, and we believe this will be an ideal solution for these kinds of applications where availability and reliability are paramount"", he comments further. DPS 112 extends the GPS capability of the DPS 110 by utilising dual frequency GLONASS signals. The addition of GLONASS signals increases positioning availability which is essential when operating close to rigs, platforms or other satellite signal obstructions. DPS 110 and DPS 112 have a built-in display for easy system configuration and status monitoring. The DPS 110/112 are additions to the existing premium DPS range comprising DPS 132/232/700/4D. ""The DPS products are well-proven as robust sources of accurate positioning with high availability for use in safety critical maritime operations. The DPS 110 and DPS 112, together with the SeaSTAR SGG service, make some of these capabilities available to a wider range of applications,"" concludes Vidar Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rkedal, VP of Sales & Customer Support at Kong",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2009/new-dgps-from-kongsberg-seatex-exploits-the-power-of-fugro-seastar-sgg/
Kongsberg Maritime challenges boundaries with new space-based AIS delivery,"Kongsberg Maritime challenges boundaries with new space-based AIS delivery On July 8 2015, ESA authorised the delivery of KONGSBERG's fourth generation SAT-AIS Receiver flight models, to the Norwegian Space Centre; for integration into the NORSAT-1 satellite. With this delivery, 
KONGSBERG further strengthens its position as a supplier of space-based infrastructure in the maritime domain. 09 Jul 2015 NORSAT-1 will be Norway's fourth AIS capable satellite to embed an AIS Receiver from Kongsberg Seatex AS. NORSAT-1 is scheduled for launch in Q1 2016 and will be Norway's fourth AIS capable satellite to embed an AIS Receiver from Kongsberg Seatex AS. The delivery is in line with previous payload models 
provided by Kongsberg Seatex, and confirms the capabilities of this exciting product line. ""The AIS Payload for NORSAT-1 is our most advanced design so far,"" says Gard Ueland, President of Kongsberg Seatex AS. ""The performance of this model is absolutely top-tier, utilising an efficient, 
flexible and future proof design. Space based infrastructure is an integral part of our strategy and the cutting-edge technology developed for space directly benefits our other product lines for offshore, 
maritime and infrastructure solutions."" An important parameter when receiving AIS messages from space is de-collision handling because the AIS Satellite will be bombarded by AIS messages from multiple AIS cells, especially in high traffic 
zones. ""By utilising modern FPGAs there is no need for high capacity downlink channels and on-ground processing. Excellent performance is achieved in the signal processing schemes in-situ. In addition, 
embedded multi-antenna support and beam-forming capabilities provide superior performance regarding AIS message detection,"" explains Project Manager Frode Storesund. The AIS payload for NORSAT-1 is KONGSBERG's most advanced design so far. The increased focus on cost/benefit in today's space programs is changing the approach to how satellite equipment is being built. The evolution in quality, power consumption and size of standard industrial 
components caters for use in a space environment with minor adjustments, without compromising performance or functionality. Software-defined technology allows for full in-orbit re-configurability. This means that a mission can evolve throughout its lifetime by software enhancements and new functionality. A recent example 
is AISSat-1, where performance and flexibility have been greatly improved during its 5 years in orbit. ""Kongsberg Seatex has refined its software-defined technology for spacecraft hardware for almost 10 years. With this latest generation SAT-AIS receiver we have had full focus on ensuring high reliability 
for even longer mission life-times. This has required multiple radiation test campaigns at several sites over the world, built-in redundancy schemes, an innovative approach on verifying COTS for flight 
and implementation of clever mitigation techniques,"" Mr. Storesund adds. The development contract for the Novel SAT-AIS Receiver (Project name: NAIS) has been under ESA's ARTES 21 program and was signed and kicked-off in February 2014. ""To deliver the flight models to the 
customer after only 16 months , is a major achievement for the KONGSBERG and ESA project team, and proves the ability to implement new technologies with a cost-effective approach and in-time for fast 
developing maritime applications,"" says Carsten Tobehn, ESA's Project Manager. ""The technology that enables AIS data availability globally has revolutionised many surveillance, monitoring and other services. There is today an impressive number of programs with new satellites 
being built for this purpose. Most of these would clearly benefit from utilising our latest technology and we are very excited about these new opportunities,"" Mr. Ueland concludes.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2015/kongsberg-maritime-challenges-boundaries-with-new-space-based-ais-delivery/
New engine performance system,"New engine performance system 25 Sep 2008 Continuous engine performance monitoring AVL sensor. As part of the company's new Green Ship strategy, Kongsberg Maritime has announced 
that it is working with Austrian power train and instrumentation specialist, AVL. 
Through this collaboration Kongsberg Maritime will integrate AVL's sophisticated 
new sensor technology with its own vessel management systems. The goal of the partnership 
is to provide a continuous engine performance monitoring system in order to increase 
vessel fuel efficiency whilst reducing fuel costs. With the increasing costs of fuels - combined with the taxation charges for emissions 
for CO2, NOx and SOx - the demands from the market for ways to analyse and, in turn, 
improve an engine's performance continue to grow rapidly. To date, the ability to 
create fuel savings of even a few percent, which can equate to savings of tens of 
thousands of dollars a year, has been limited as current sensor technology cannot 
provide optimal engine efficiency through continuous monitoring. Up to 600 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½C AVL's new sensors however, which the company developed as part of its engine 
performance & optimisation system (AVL EPOS) are based on gallium orthophosphate 
crystals, which can operate in temperatures up to 600 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½C, as opposed to traditional 
quartz crystal sensors that can only operate up to around 275 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½C. This makes it 
possible for the first time to provide continuous engine performance monitoring. Kongsberg Maritime has enabled AVL to bring this technology to the marine world, 
and will be offering continuous engine performance monitoring through its integrated 
systems, such as the K-Chief automation system, MBB VDR and the FleetMaster electronic 
logbook. Traditional engine performance monitoring systems have required manual 
intervention; however AVL's approach is completely different and, when combined 
with Kongsberg Maritime's control systems experience, will bring about a sea change 
in engine perfong ""Unlike previous systems, our sensors are fitted to points on the engines and 
remain there throughout their lifetime. This means that they are able to continuously 
monitor the engine's performance and constantly provide detailed analysis of the 
situation whenever required,"" explains Dr. Ruediger Teichmann, AVL's global business 
segment manager, combustion measurement division. ""We are very proud of the work 
we have done in being able to develop these new crystal sensors and Kongsberg Maritime's 
knowledge of the shipping sector means they understand the value of such a technology."" The AVL EPOS with the new sensor technology and Kongsberg Maritime's integrated 
systems are currently working together onboard Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½egh Autoliners' 6,100 vehicle capacity 
car carrier, the Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½EGH DETROIT - AKA, the Green Ship Project. Although it is a complex 
system, the interface is simple, meaning that a broader range of crewmembers can 
use it. It uses a practical 'traffic light' system to notify crew of any performance 
problems. This information is currently used onboard and sent manually to the shore 
office. However, as the trial continues automatic reporting to the shore office 
via Inmarsat will be implemented. Fuel savings Morten Olsen, Sales & Marketing Manager of Kongsberg Maritime Europe and America, 
is particularly impressed with the pace of ""Our 
two companies have worked extremely well in a short timeframe to bring our complementary 
skills to bear on a challenging problem. With environmental concerns and fuel savings 
being at the top of every shipowner's agenda, I believe together we have swiftly 
created a product that can have a major positive impact on any vessel's green performance.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/new-engine-performance-system/
GeoSwath Sonars play a key role in South Australia port development,"GeoSwath Sonars play a key role in South Australia port development Two GeoSwath wide swath bathymetric sonars are being used for regular hydrographic port surveys around the South Australian coast, providing bathymetry and side scan data for use in the development and maintenance of this important national infrastructure. Recent projects include the pre, progress, and post-dredge monitoring of the major shipping channels to Port Adelaide and Port Giles which were deepened to accommodate panamax vessels. 15 Apr 2009 The Felix, a trailerable 5 metre NoosaCat 1800-Series boat with a mounting plate for a customised 250kHz GeoSwath transducer arm fixed to the port side gunwale. The Pathfinder, an 11 metre NoosaCat 3900-Series boat with a 250kHz GeoSwath head deployed on a central 'periscope'-mount between the hulls. HydroSurvey Australia is the hydrographic survey business arm of Flinders Ports, with the core task of performing recurrent surveys of navigational channels and berths for design and maintenance purposes. As well as using the GeoSwath data for planning future port developments this survey programme is an integral part of Flinders Ports' risk mitigation strategy. HydroSurvey now carries out regular navigational hydrographic work at all the main shipping ports and minor boat havens in South Australia, over 100km of channels and 50 berths. As a core part of their expanding range of survey equipment HydroSurvey has taken delivery of a second GeoSwath interferometric sonar from GeoAcoustics Ltd (Great Yarmouth, UK), a Kongsberg Maritime Company. The wide swath width demonstrated by their first GeoSwath (delivered in 2000 and upgraded in 2004) allowed unprecedented rapid survey coverage in shallow waters, resulting in significant productivity gains and achieving total insonification over large areas, with sounding data exceeding IHO S44 special order survey standard for depth accuracy. The two GeoSwath systems are mounted on HydroSurvey's NoosaCat twin-hulled survey launches. The 'Pathfinder' is an 11 metre NoosaCat 3900-Series with a 250kHz GeoSwath head deployed on a central 'periscope'-mount between the hulls. The 'Felix' is a trailerable 5 metre NoosaCat 1800-Series with a mounting plate for a customised 250kHz GeoSwath transducer arm fixed to the port side gunwale. In addition to their core survey functions, HydroSurvey Australia undertakes contract hydrographic and bathymetric surveys for various projects including: design and construction of commercial ports and marinas; locating shoals and reefs; and to measure coastal sand migration. The GeoSawth Sonar's shallow water capabilities also make it ideal for river and lake surveys; in 2001 HydroSurvey were commissioned to survey Lake Burragorang (behind Warragamba Dam), 60km west of Sydney. With a storage volume of 2 million megalitres this is one of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world, supplying approximately 80% of the water delivered to Sydney. Sydney Catchment Authority required a bathymetric survey to measure the volume of sedimentation post-construction and to form a baseline for future surveys.

Multi beam echo sounder trials - HMS Endurance,"Multi beam echo sounder trials - HMS Endurance 02 Aug 2006 The following story comes from the ship's diary of the Royal Navy ice patrol ship HMS Endurance. From the ship's diary Previously unlocated wreck identified in 130m of water. Photo courtesy HMS Endurance Immediately following the success of the International Festival of the Sea HMS 
ENDURANCE sailed to conduct trials on her recently commissioned ef designated EM710S. This is a state of the art system, at the leading 
edge of multi beam echo sounder technology and one of only two equipment at sea. The other is fitted 
in the Canadian Arctic icebreaking ship MATTHEW. Developed by the Norwegian commercial 
sonar specialists Kongsberg Maritime it has been especially designed to fit flush 
with our ice breaking hull. As can be seen from the accompanying image the results 
achieved are quite incredible, with this previously unlocated wreck being detected 
and readily identified in 130m of water. But how does the system work? The following attempts to explain: A pulse of sound is radiated vertically under the hull of the ship from the transmit 
array. With the application of very sophisticated processing at the receive array 
the returning echo is divided into 200 beams. Thus a swathe of data of up to 4 times 
the water depth is collected. This is a quantum leap forward in our surveying capability. 
Previously the ship has operated a Single Beam Echo Sounder recovering 1 sounding 
from beneath the ship, with the data density achieved being a function of line spacing 
between survey lines. Now line spacing can be increased and much more data can be 
captured. Typical results of multi beam echo sounder survey. Photo courtesy HMS Endurance This then means that we can generate highly detailed 3-D images of the sea bed, 
all while surveying at 5 times the efficiency of previous SBES work. The wreck was 
detected on our first pass and with increased data contributing from four more passes 
at different ranges and orientations the processing software was able to construct 
the image of the wreck, which is believed to be a fishing vessel lying upright on 
the sea floor. The upper image represents each data point (the white squares), the 
lower image is colour banded to show depth differences. The wreck stands 8m high 
above a relatively flat surrounding seabed. With some interpretation it is easy 
to imagine an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Aï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ frame gantry at the stern of the vessel (right hand side of the 
images) immediately ahead of a flat working deck, a pointed bow forward (left hand 
side) and between a raised deckhouse and wheelhouse. As intimated the system is complex. We have very accurate positioning systems, 
which can generate a position precise to less than 2m anywhere on the globe. Similarly 
we have a series of fibre optic gyros which measure the orientation of the ship 
to a precision of less than 0.05 degrees. This means that the multi beam sonar is 
continuously and accurately corrected for all movement of the ship, allowing the 
deptributing significantly to the 
our safe navigation in the areas we survey. We also have to precisely measure the 
sound velocity profile, deploying a sensitive probe which indicates how the speed 
of sound in water varies with depth. This is deployed from a winch with an 800m 
depth capability. When deployed off the coast of Florida it attracted the attention 
of a playful fish, possibly a shark, which left a series off teeth marks in the casing of the probe! We will use the multi beam echo sounder extensively during our next deployment to the Antarctic. 
As agreed by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office we will operate the new system 
in various locations to improve our knowledge of the topography beneath the waves. 
Our data will also contribute to the safe navigation of other vessels visiting the region. About the HMS Endurance The ice patrol ship HMS Endurance.

companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s market leading fifth generation range of MRUs and have been designed specifically for survey and crane operations, and outside installations such as helideck monitoring. The new MRU 3 is designed for roll, pitch and heave compensation applications including real-time heave compensation of echo sounders during survey operations and active heave compensation of offshore 
cranes. It provides heave measurements to meet Ihighly accurate pre and post processing, whilst offshore crane safety and efficiency can be also be improved. 
The MRU 3 achieves high reliability by using solid state sensors with no rotational or mechanical parts. A second new model, the MRU E, is specially designed for use in marine applications that require an extended temperature range. It can operate at ambient temperatures from -25 to +70ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½C and can be installed 
on open decks, inside cabinets or on bulkheads. Typical applications include direct mounting under the helideck centre to measure 3-axes linear accelerations together with roll, pitch and heave. Because 
of the extended temperature range of the MRU E, no additional enclosure or cabinet is required and the system meets Helideck Certification Agency (HCA) requirements to measure helideck acceleration and 
calculate Motion Severity Index (MSI). Both new MRUs accept input of external speed and heading information on separate serial lines or Ethernet for improved accuracy in heave, uring turns and accelerations. For time synchronization 
the MRU accepts 1-second time pulse (1PPS) input on a TTL line (XIN) or as RS-232 or 422 signal. The MRU 3 and MRU E also make data available through an Ethernet interface enabling easy distribution to

Deakin University brings historic shipwreck to life with the EM 2040C and CARIS,"Deakin University brings historic shipwreck to life with the EM 2040C and CARIS 16 Dec 2013 Deakin University, one of Australia's leading universities, has acquired CARIS HIPS and SIPS as part of the Deakin University Warrnambool Marine and Aquaculture Science Research Initiative, which aims 
to boost marine research and teaching in the region. MV Yolla, Deakin University's 10 metre research vessel based in Warrnambool, was also recently equipped with the new KONGSBERG EM 2040C multibeam echosounder, one of the 
first in the world. Students used the new multibeam to collect data from a local wreck site, the La Bella shipwreck, a four-masted barquentine sailing ship used as a trading vessel, which sank in 1905. La Bella is one 
of the many historic shipwrecks in Australia used as a diving site attraction for qualified divers. See details of the shipwreck in the composite image below, to the right. Using the CUBE workflow for bathymetric processing, along with the new water column imaging functionality available in HIPS and SIPS 8.0, students were able to produce some key findings. Students also 
took particular interest in backscatter processing to aid in habitat mapping as part of their research. The EM 2040C bathymetric datasets have captivated all of the professionals who worked during the acquisition and post-processing tasks. The research also included processing backscatter datasets which 
were extremely useful for habitat mapping studies and applications. The Marine and Freshwater Sciences research group focuses on the ecology and management of coastal marine and estuarine ecosystems, cutting edge technologies for mapping marine habitats, the effects 
of a drying climate on ecological function and biodiversity in rivers and streams, river restoration, the ecology and management of marine wildlife, population genetics of marine invertebrates and sustainable

of Kongsberg's newest seabed mapping technology, including: EM 120 (1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) - Deep-water Multibeam echo Sounder for mapping to full 
	ocean depth EA 600 (200, 38, 12 kHz) - Multi-frequency Single Beam echo sounder for 
	surveying at all depths SBP 120 (3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) - Deep-water Sub-Bottom Profiler for high-resolution sub-bottom 
	data to full ocean depth Gondola measuring 8 meters across (athwartshipsInstruments) - Multi-frequency Doppler Current 
	Profiler for shallow and deep current profiling EM 710 (0.5ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½x 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) - Intermediate Depth Multibeam Echo Sounder All of the acoustic sensors wer""gondola"" measuring 
8 meters across (athwartships) and over 14 meters in length. Sea Acceptance Tests Numerous small targets on seafloor detected by EM 710. Some as small as 1m x 1m or less. The Sea Acceptance Tests and performance evaluations were conducted in 1) the 
deep-water environment of the southeastern Philippine Sea (Parece Vela Basin), 2) 
the very deep southern Mariana Trench, and 3) the shallow-intermediate seafloor 
depths around the islands of Saipan, Anatahan and Guam in the Mariana Island arc 
chain. The EM 120 was tested to the deepest spot in the ocean, the Challenger Deep 
in the Mariana Trench, that has a nominal depth of 11,000m. The system successfully 
tracked bottom to full ocean depth while maintaining swath coverage in excess of 
23 kilometers. The EM 710 tracked bottom to greater than 2,000m; covering a swath 
of 1 km at that depth. The Saipan reef offered numerous target detection testing 
opportunities. Analysis by NAVOCEANO and their representatives proved the EM 710 
system capable of meeting IHO Special Order target detection requirements. The SBP 120 system achieved penetration of at least 80-85m in the depth zones 
tested (3,000- 11,000m), exceeding the contract requirements. Shown above are images processed by Dr. Sungat Altis, NAVOCEANO. Opinions expressed 
regarding the meeting of contract requirements are purely those of Kongsberg and 
have not been reviewed or endorsed by Dr. Altis. The USNS Sumner Sea Acceptance 
Test was followed by a comprehensive training program (conducted onboard the vessel) 
covering all five sonar systems and custom software developed to meet system integration 
and data format requirements. For example, the Kongsberg Data Logger provides for 
remote control, logging and data routing of the EM 120, EM 710, SBP 120 and EA 600 
through NAVOCEANOï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ISS-60 survey control and data management system. All work was 
concluded on August 18, 2007. The next vessel in this class of six scheduled for the Multibeam Sonar System 
upgrade is the Ustallation - Spring 2008).",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/first-t-ags-60-class-upgrade-complete/

KONGSBERG equipment lab. Kongsberg Maritime's USA subsidiary, Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. reports the acceptance by the US Navy in December 2007 of two further multibeam upgrades for its fleet of oceanographic vessels. The two systems are part of the US $42 million contract for upgrades to the six existing and one future T-AGS 60 class survey vessels operated by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). The two new multibeam systems passed the FAT with flying colors. One is scheduled to be installed on the USNS Pathfinder (TAGS-60) in 2009 and the second system will be installed on the newest vessel, T-AGS 66, which is yet to be constructed. These installations will follow the successful installation of the first multibeam upgrade on the USNS Sumner (T-AGS 61) in 2007 and the upcoming installation of the USNS Bowditch (T-AGS 62) in 2008. The new sonar systems are a replacement for the current equipment, including the Kongsberg EM 121A, 12 kHz multibeam originally installed when the vessels were constructed in the early 1990s. Five fully integrated sonar systems where tested as part of the two FATs: EM 122 (1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) - Deep-water Multibeam echo Sounder (DMS) for mapping to full ocean depth EM 710 (0.5ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Shallow to Intermediate depth Multibeam echo sounder EA 600 (200, 38, 12 kHz) - Multi-frequency Single Beam echo (MSB) sounder for surveying in all depths SBP 120 (3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) - Deep-water Sub-Bottom Profiler (DSBP) for high-resolution sub-bottom data to full ocean depth ADCP (supplied from Teledyne RD Instruments) - Multi-frequency Doppler Current Profiler for shallow and deep current profiling Additionall be used to eliminate acoustic interference between the many sonars located onboard, allowing for more efficient surveying.

cNODE transponders chosen for Ivory Field conductor anchor node installation,"cNODE transponders chosen for Ivory Field conductor anchor node installation 25 Jun 2014 The Ivory field, operated by Centrica, is located in the Norwegian Sea, license PL528 near the Aasta Hansteen development in just over 1400m of water. Prior to the Q4 2014 drilling campaign a suction 
conductor anchor node (CAN) was installed with SSBL by DOF Subsea, to a tolerance of better than ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½10m in absolute position and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1.0 degree in inclination. As the contrac""Normand Reach"" was equipped with a Dual HiPAP 501 SSBL/LBL acoustic positioning system, cNODE transponders operating with CYMBAL digital ranging and telemetry 
were chosen to meet the positioning and attitude tolerance of the CAN installation. The equipment for the job was mobilized by Kongsberg Maritime Ltd, Aberdeen, which stocks a large rental pool of cNODE transponders and ROV transducers to meet the needs of subsea construction and survey projects. 
One cNODE transponder was interfaced to an Ashtead external gyro package providing heading, pitch and roll. For redundancy 
two additional cNODE transponders equipped with Multi Sensor Modules, including high accuracy inclinometers, were fitted to the top of the CAN. A dedicated APOS survey operator station is installed in the online room to allow shared use of the HIPAP between DP and survey. The cNODE transponders were interrogated in ""Fast track"" mode. Simultaneous update of position and sensor data for all of cNODE transponders was acquired every 3 seconds in 1400m of water. Data from 
the gyro package and the inclinometers are embedded in the normal navigation pulse, and don't require any extra telemetry messages to be transmitted. The suction CAN was installed in its final position within tolerance. The position, gyro and inclinometer data was telemetered acoustically continuously from the time the suction can was hung into 
the water, throughout the lowering and for the entire suction operation. In addition the gyro package displayed the heading pitch and roll on an ROV LED display. Below from the online room during the operation. This is the control room for the two Kystdesign Supporter Work Class ROV systems and for the survey team. After final installation the transponders and gyro package were recovered from the CAN and an LBL array of 8 Kongsberg transponders, were installed for the next phase of the project. The shared use of the vessels HiPAP as a DP and construction survey tool enhances operational efficiencies, by providing high speed positioning and communication of target transponders, when the ROV 
is on deck and without the need for a dedicated over the side transducer pole.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/cnode-transponders-chosen-for-ivory-field-conductor-anchor-node-installation/

from ship to shore, the shipping company's operation management is able to decide 
the most economical operating modes for the ship's engine and propulsion system. Vice President of Offshore and Marine at Kongsberg Maritime, Morten Hasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, says 
that the acquisition is an important addition to Kongsberg Maritime's strategy for 
developing a green product line. Green""Our primary goal within the green ships strategy is to ensure optimal running 
of the machinery, resulting in less emissions. One way of achieving this is to adjust 
the ship optimally, using these measurements as a baseline. The torque measurement 
offered by Metasystems gives an indication of the ship's performance compared to 
the initial baseline, thereby limiting the risk of over-stressing the engine, which 
reduces maintenance and repair costs. In addition they enable accurate calculation 
of fuel consumption per kWh produced by the engine. By combining this technology 
with our already existing equipment we aim to integrate a 'green' concept throughout 
our entire product range,"" said Hasï¿½ï",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/kongsberg-maritime-acquires-metasystems/
Kongsberg Maritime celebrates the first customer for its innovative Extended Thruster Coverage programme,"Kongsberg Maritime celebrates the first customer for its innovative Extended Thruster Coverage programme 22 Apr 2021 Tuomas Raumanen (middel) and Alfons Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½kans signs an agreement with Jouni Raatikainen and Jarmo Vanha-aho of Kongsberg Maritime for long-term support via KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Extended Thruster Coverage programme Kongsberg Maritime (KM) has signed a contract to provide KMï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s innovative new Extended Thruster Coverage (ETC) service programme to support two new ice-breaking escort tugs, currently in build at Sanmar shipyard for the Finnish towage company Alfons Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½kans. The agreement covers the support of the tugsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ robust US255 thrusters and ND Aquapilot remote control systems. ETC is an efficient, proactive new business model which replaces KMï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s previous time- and material-based customer support approach with a fixed yearly fee. The new service programmeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ns will optimise fleet equipment maintenance standards across the tugboat industry. The through-life support offered by the ETC programme will help ensure reliable harbour towage and ice-breaking operations for the two vessels, which will operate in the Finnish and Baltic seas. Tuomas Raumanen, Technical Manager at Alfons Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½kans, says: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have a long and intensive co-operation with KONGSBERG, and have over 20 tugs fitted with Kongsberg ASD units.

Kongsberg Maritime delivers bespoke training course to reduce DP incidents in offshore industries,"Kongsberg Maritime delivers bespoke training course to reduce DP incidents in offshore industries SAIPEM commissions tailored emergency scenario training course as a means of preventing DP incidents 20 Feb 2019 The oil & gas industry contractor SAIPEM, recently commissioned DP (dynamic positioning) market and technology leader Kongsberg Maritime to deliver a tailored DP emergency scenario training course for its employees, at the Kongsberg Maritime training centre in Kongsberg, Norway. SAIPEM has decided to put all their pertinent crews through the course, in total a series of ten courses will be held. DP, in which a vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s heading and position are automatically managed by computer-controlled inputs to the craftï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s thrusters and propellers, has proved to be an invaluable manoeuvring technology for decades, particularly in offshore contexts such as cable-laying, drilling and oceanographic research. However, a reported global escalation in DP incidents promptnce in bringing its staff fully up to speed with DP and related operational factors by means of a bespoke training course. The course was centered on avoiding DP incidents that could negatively impact operational safety and the wider environment. Such incidents can occur for a multitude of reasons including power failure, lost or drifting wind/position/motion sensors and gyrocompasses, and, inevitably, human factors which can significantly impair decision-making and communication in emergency scenarios. All of these aspects and more were addressed in the four-day course, which was prefaced by a 40-question DP system knowledge test. This was undertaken by attendees to pinpoint shortfalls in competence and system understanding before the training started. The course itself began with a one-day familiarisation to the KONGSBERG K-Pos DP operator interface and cJoy joystick control system. This was followed in turn by extensive use of Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s DNV Class A K-Sim Offshore trainiarticipants to realistic DP situations, focusing on operations carried out by SAIPEMï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pipelaying vessel, Castorone, while stress-testing CAMO (Critical Activity Mode of Operation) and ASOG (Activity Specific Operating Guidelines) risk-management methods. The K-Sim Offshore simulator, bolstered with role play, enabled course attendees to replicate procedures including emergency manoeuvring and close-proximity emergency station keeping. The training activities helped SAIPEM employees to identify DP errors, hone their situational awareness, evaluate situations and implement appropriate measures. Simulator exercises of this nature provide training instructors with a lucid overview of individual responses and their potential effect on team dynamics and incident outcomes, generating insights which go far beyond those available via traditional classroom-based coaching. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s comprehensive course allowed our DPOs to carry otial consequences,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Roberta Tamburro, Training Centre Manager, SAIPEM. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The simulator exercises enabled them to self-assess their emergency responses in a stressful environment. Furthermore, debriefs after each exercise and open discussions throughout cemented the view that the course represented a fully rounded and deeply beneficial learning experience.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Kongsberg Maritime has more than three decades of successful experience in supplying training courses to companies within the offshore and wider maritime industries,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ adds Ole Aleksander Ottesen , DP Instructor, Kongsberg Maritime, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and this reflects our overall standing as a standard-bearer of industry excellence.

The world's largest volcano,"The world's largest volcano Recently, scientists have described what is being called the largest volcano on the planet. In an article in the journal Nature Geoscience, Dr. William Sager and his coauthors present evidence from multichannel seismic and core data indicating that the province known as the Tamu Massif is a shield volcano several hundred kilometers across. 16 Dec 2013 The site, one of three provinces of the massive Shatsky Rise plateau, is located roughly 1000 km east of Japan in the northwest Pacific Ocean. As part of their investigation, scientists conducted research cruises in 2010 and 2012 aboard the R/V Marcus G. Langseth, a geophysical research vessel operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, of Columbia University. In addition to multichannel seismic survey capabilities, the Langseth is equipped with an EM122 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ x 1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ multibeam echo sounder system. The large extent of this site is such that it would take a substantial effort to collect bathymetry and ture, across depths of 2000-5000 meters. Data from the EM122 aboard R/V Langseth collected during cruise MGL 1004, over the shallowest portion of the Tamu Massif, 2000-4000m. Data used in this image was downloaded from the National Geophysical Data Center and processed by Kongsberg Underwater Technology. Multichannel seismic and core data was critical in defining the subsurface expressions that helped characterize the nature of the site. However, it is clear that the multibeam data presents morphological features worthy of further investigation. In the meantime, regional bathymetry must be assembled by merging high resolution multibeam data with coarse satellite altimetry and sparse single beam data, as has been common practice for most of the deep ocean. We hope KONGSBERG systems will contribute to a more detailed understanding of this, and other large discoveries, in the future.

Kongsberg Maritime awarded offshore renewables contract with Aquamarine Power,"Kongsberg Maritime awarded offshore renewables contract with Aquamarine Power 26 Oct 2011 Kongsberg Maritime Ltd, the UK subsidiary of global marine technology company Kongsberg Maritime, has been awarded a contract with leading wave energy technology provider Aquamarine Power to carry 
out underwater noise assessments relating to its Oyster wave energy device. The Oyster device has been developed by Aquamarine Power to capture wave energy from near-shore sites and convert it into clean 
sustainable electricity. The contract represents a first collaboration between Kongsberg Maritime and Aquamarine Power, and will involve the company measuring underwater noise during the Oyster installation and operational 
phases at the EMEC range, Billia Croo on Orkney. The project scope will also involve Kongsberg Maritime determining the acoustic impact associated with installing and operating the Oyster device when 
it is subsequently operating in a high energy wave environment. This phase will take place off the north-west coast of the Isle of Lewis.The next-generation Oyster 800 wave energy device was recently 
installed at the EMEC site in Orkney, where the installation noise was captured by Kongsberg Maritime as part of the project scope, and there are plans to install two further Oyster devices at the same 
site in 2012 and 2013. Each device will have a generating capacity of 800kW. Having completed the first phase of the project at Billia Croo, Kongsberg Maritime will shortly embark on measuring the underwater noise once the Oyster device is operating. These activities undertaken 
by Kongsberg Maritime will allow the environmental impact of the wave energy device outside the EMEC site to be assessed in context. As part of the project, Kongsberg Maritime used its autonomous underwater noise recording system known as RUNES to conduct baseline noise measurement at the Isle of Lewis site. The RUNES system, simple 
in its deployment method, is placed on the seabed over an extended period of time while recording baseline noise prior to any construction or installation work being carried out. Using the RUNES system removed the need for surface support vessels and personnel during the main operation, helping to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency. The absence of trailing hydrophones 
and vessel noise also meant that the data collected at the Isle of Lewis site was of significantly higher quality, allowing for clearer interpretation and analysis. The data collected during the baseline noise studies, combined with the underwater noise data gathered at the Billia Croo site, will contribute to an assessment of the potential effects of underwater 
noise on marine mammals, fish and diving birds at the site once the Oyster device is installed and operational. Kongsberg Maritime technology is utilised in all phases of offshore renewable energy, from the planning and consent phases through to installation and maintenance of offshore renewable structures. 
Within the industry, Kongsberg Maritime is the leading supplier of ship positioning, navigation and marine automation systems for turbine installation and cable-lay vessels, with its AUVs and multibeam 
technology frequently used for conducting seabed surveys and mapping.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/kongsberg-maritime-awarded-offshore-renewables-contract-with-aquamarine-power/

New Underwater Positioning Systems and Transponders unveiled by Kongsberg Maritime,"New Underwater Positioning Systems and Transponders unveiled by Kongsberg Maritime 06 May 2010 Range of systems to utilise proprietary new signal processing protocol. Kongsberg Maritime is showcasing an advanced new range of acoustic underwater positioning systems and transponders, designed to harness the power of 'Cymbal', Kongsberg Maritime's sophisticated new signal processing protocol whilst also being backwards 
compatible with the HPR 400 protocol and analogue transponders. In addition to a new family of transponders called cNODE, new systems on display at OTC include HiPAP 501/451/351/351P, which are the second generation of Kongsberg Maritime's de facto industry 
standard acoustic underwater positioning system and offer improved position accuracy, longer range capability and faster data telemetry. The new cNODE series of transponders consists of three models: Maxi ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a full size transponder with large battery capacity, floating collar and release mechanism, and long life opera for seabed deployment. Midi ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a short transponder 
with good battery capacity perfectly suited for subsea construction work and Mini ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a small transponder for ROV/AUV mounting and subsea construction work. cPAP, a new compact subsea transceiver, designed for ROV positioning is also part of the new transponder 
family. cNODE transponders feature full acoustic telemetry links and can operate with both Cymbal and HPR400 acoustics so vessels not using the new Cymbal protocol can still benefit from the performance of the new transponders. Because cNODE transponders 
are modeless, they can operate on both SSBL and LBL positioning without changing the mode of the transponder. All cNODE transponders have aluminium housing and 4000m depth rating as standard. They feature a modular design based on standard housings (a steel transponder housing for special operation is available) that may have various add-on modules attached, 
including different transducers (from omn different internal sensors (inclinometer, depth, sound velocity), interface for external sensors and release mechanisms. A Transponder Test and Configuration unit 
(TTC cNODE), for acoustic test on deck, configuration and software download is also available. The new, Kongsberg Maritime developed Cymbal acoustic protocol used by cNODE and the second generation HiPAP family is designed for accurate positioning of subsea transponders in SSBL/LBL mode and data communication with subsea transponders, and BOP 
control systems. It utilises Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) signals for positioning and variable speed data communication, and can be adapted to the acoustic communication conditions; noise and multi-path. The Cymbal protocol provides new characteristics for both positioning and data communication, including: Improved range capability and accuracy to 0.01m, reduced impact from noise, directional measurements for more robust positioning, expanded power 
management for greater battery lifetime, variable data rate to secure longer range and highly reliable communication, and integrated navigation and data link that sends critical data between the positioning signals.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/new-underwater-positioning-systems-and-transponders-unveiled-by-kongsberg/

Lï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½greid says that the bank aims to contribute to the development of this type of high-tech business in Western Norway. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
Subsea is a very important industry in our region.We have a good collaboration with GCE Subsea. It is a forward-thinking organisation with global ambitions. To us at Sparebanken Vest, it is 
important to keep up with what goes on in our region to continue to offer good advice to our customers and partners in the future. Great Cost Saving Potential CEO Kristin Y. hey are very honoured to receive the award and the recognition this represents from the subsea cluster. Eelume is a spin-off company from NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology), and its technology is based on extensive research on snake robotics and marine control systems. Eelume is 
developing a disruptive solution for underwater inspection and intervention in the form of a swimming robot. The idea is to let these robots perform inspection and light intervention jobs on the seabed, thus reducing the use of large and expensive surface vessels. With its snake-like form, the slender and 
flexible body of the Eelume robot provides access to confined areas that are difficult to access with existing technology. Eelume robots will be permanently installed on the seabed and will perform planned and on-demand inspections and interventions. The solution can be installed on both existing and new fields where 
typical jobs include; visual inspection, cleaning, and adjusting valves and chokes. These jobs account for a large portion of the total subsea inspection and intervention spend. Eelume collaborates with Kongsberg Maritime and Statoil to accelerate this new technology that will significantly reduce costs related to subsea inspection and intervention operations. The strength 
of the collaboration lies in the unique contributions from each of the parties. They have combined the forces of three world-class players within their fields of expertise: Statoil with a unique position in subsea development and operations, will give access to subsea installation for testing and qualification Kongsberg Maritime with their unique AUV presence and track record for developing novel technologies NTNU within the domain of snake robotics and marine automation Eelume was founded by top academics from NTNU one year ago next week, and are currently in the process of recruiting a strong development team. - We first came in contact with GCE Subsea (then NCE) late in the summer of last year and were given the opportunity to join the Subsea Next Step programme. During this programme, we managed to 
shift our focus from a technical and academic project to a lean start-up company basing our development on customer interaction and feedback. The Subsea Next Step programme made us change our approach and become more customer and market focused. It also enabled us to understand the end-customers and helped us engage with and land this

KONGSBERG Hugin completes world's longest multi-sensor AUV pipeline inspection,"KONGSBERG Hugin completes world's longest multi-sensor AUV pipeline inspection 03 Mar 2011 Kongsberg Maritime developed AUV, instruments and software combine for high performance survey. The first 8-hour mission (green line). A single 3 Megapixel camera image. Altitude 4.6 m. Resolution 2x2 mm. HISAS image. Area 120x90 m. Range 32-152m. Resolution 35x35 mm. Raw bathymetry from EM3002. Area shown 120x120 m. KONGSBERG has completed the world's longest multi-sensor AUV pipeline survey using one of its cutting-edge HUGIN Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). The pipeline inspection took place 
February 9th ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 11th 2011, in the Hjelte fjord near Bergen, Norway and the HUGIN was operated from the Royal Norwegian Navy vessel HNoMS Maloy. The subject of the inspection was two subsea pipelines going to the Mongstad oil refinery. The HUGIN AUV was equipped with a an advanced suite of KONGSBERG imaging equipment including the 
HISAS 1030 synthetic aperture sonar, EM3002 multibeam echo sounder an LED lighting. The instruments were used to inspect around 30 km of subsea pipeline in an 8-hour, two-pass 
mission. In the first pass, side-scan data from the HISAS 1030 sonar was used to detect and track the pipelines in real-time, using PipeTracker software for pipeline detection and tracking extracted 
pipe-like features in the sonar images, with a high degree of robustness towards false detections. The PipeTracker software, which was developed in a collaborative effort with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) in a project funded by the Norwegian Research Council, runs as a 
plug-in module in the standard HUGIN payload system. The HUGIN control system in turn uses the identified pipeline tracks to position the vehicle at an optimal range for HISAS imaging. The whole 
process is fully automated inside the AUV and requires no operator intervention. In the second pass, HUGIN followed the pipeline tracks identified in the first pass at low altitude and inspected the pipelines using the EM 3002 multibeam (now available as the more modern EM 2040) and the optical camera. After the 
mission, the recorded HISAS 1030 data was post-processed into high-resolution (4x4 cm) sonar images and bathymetry maps of the pipeline. Together with the optical images and the multi-beam data 
recorded in the second pass, this gave a detailed view of the pipeline surroundings and the pipeline itself. The complete procedure was repeated the next day over the second pipeline in a new 8-hour, 
two-pass mission. Both pipelines were surveyed at a constant speed of 4 knots and at 4-25m altitude, depending on the sensor in use. Water depth was 180-560m. The greater speed of the HUGIN compared to that of 
a ROV meant that 60km of pipeline could be inspected in a little over 16 hours during the two passes. Furthermore, the stability of the HUGIN platform and the ability to simultaneously operate both at 
high speed and at low altitude resulted in an efficient survey with crystal clear images from the onboard optical camera. Kongsberg Maritime and subsidiary Hydroid offer 'Full Picture' HUGIN and REMUS AUV solutions, where the vehicles themselves and required instruments can be supplied by Kongsberg Maritime, ensuring 
users have a single company to co-operate with for any kind of survey. The company is aligning the two product lines, providing users operational synergies and a strengthened technology base, suitable 
for all underwater survey applications. The PipeTracker software module has been developed in a collaborative effort with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) in project funded by the 
Norwegian Research Council (the FORNY-program).",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/kongsberg-hugin-completes-worlds-longest-multi-sensor-auv-pipeline-inspection/

New K-Pos dynamic positioning controller,"New K-Pos dynamic positioning controller 23 Aug 2006 On display at ONS A smarter simpler and safer dynamic positioning controller. Providing users with more operational reliability and less cost of ownership. The new K-Pos Dynamic Positioning Controller (DPC), based on KONGSBERG System 
Technology, will be shown for the first time on the Kongsberg Maritime stand at 
ONS 2006. Segregation and redundancy The unique design of the new DPC extends the principles of system segregation 
and redundancy that result in the robustness and high system availability of the 
K-Pos dynamic positioning system. The system utilises a scalable module concept 
which corresponds to the overall architecture of a dynamic positioning system and 
may be equipped with one, two or three processor units, supporting single, dual 
and triple redundant dynamic positioning control systems. Increased redundancy The processors are synchronized on a dual network that is separated from the 
process network, which is reserved for communication with other segments of a vessel 
system using KONGSBERG System Technology. This solution ensures that the DP controller 
will continue operation even if there is a system failure at a higher level, providing 
increased redundancy and therefore safety and operational reliability. Support friendly The DPC is supplied in a cabinet that is arranged for a logical approach to controller 
upgrades as well as to installation and fault finding. The same cabinet can be used 
for single and dual systems, though triple systems use an additional top section 
for the third processor. The hardware concept for a redundant solution contains: Main processors with dedicated processor synchronization network Dual process LAN for communication with Operator Stations and other IAS 
	units I/O modules snapped on to rails with built-in dual power and RBus, i.e. 
	high speed serial I/O-bus For stand-alone systems: full segregation per thruster, one I/O module per 
	unit. Built-in galvanic isolation and loop monitoring. Segregation of serial line I/O. Each serial line input is read by all main 
	processors. Smarter, simpler and safer ""Our new Dynamic Positioning Controller is smarter, simpler and safer, providing 
users with more operational reliability and less cost of ownership,"" comments Roy 
Larsen, Kongsberg Maritime. ""KONGSBERG System Technology is being implemented across 
a wide range of key shipboard systems, providing a real difference in operation 
through utilisation of a common, shipe-wide system architecture and where possible, 
common user-interface.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2006/new-k-pos-dynamic-positioning-controller/

Klaipeda Harbour seabed mapped with GeoSwath Plus,"Klaipeda Harbour seabed mapped with GeoSwath Plus The Lithuanian Coastal Research and Planning Institute (CORPI) has recently completed the first ever 100% coverage survey of Klaipeda Harbour using the Kongsberg GeoAcoustics GeoSwath Plus COMPACT multibeam echo sounder system. 21 Aug 2013 GeoSwath Plus COMPACT transducer head, 500 kHz. This EU funded project was carried out during the implementation of the Sustainable Management of Contaminated Sediments (SMOCS) Project, developed under the framework of the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007-2013 ( http://eu.baltic.net/ ). The work focuses on the mapping of contaminated sediments in the modern port development area. Full-scale, shallow water multibeam, side-scan sea floor imagery and seismic mapping were carried out by CORPI's staff in order to gain a full understanding of the morphology and distribution of the seabed sediments. This project has special significance as it provides new information for on-going dredging work and for future harbour developments which, relying on these new data, can now be developed right up to the maximum possible depths. For sustainable future development this highly dynamic environment needs to be fully understood, with proper recognition of the seabed morphology and sedimentary patterns of superficial deposits essential. CORPI project information. CORPI's main scientific activity is interdisciplinary research for sustainable coastal zone management, which includes analysis and forecasting of the changes in the marine environment as well as development of the scientific knowledge necessary for the sustainable management of coastal resources.

Big find for CSIRO's Southern Surveyor,"Big find for CSIRO's Southern Surveyor 06 Dec 2011 As a developer of systems that allow us to look into the hidden secrets of the oceans, Kongsberg Maritime has played its part in many amazing discoveries over the years. Scientists all over the world use our hydroacoustic technology to get a clear view on what is happening below the waves. Detailed seafloor mapping obtained using the EM 300 multibeam echosounder system. Rocks from the abyss more than 1.5 km below the surface. Some projects support industry in locating and extracting vital resources or help scientists to present a stunning picture of the exotic plant and animal life below the surface. Other projects, like a recently concluded survey aboard the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's (CSIRO) RV Southern Surveyor, help us peer into the past, giving a greater understanding of the geology that has shaped our world. Researchers from the University of Sydney, Macquarie University and the University of Tasmania led an international team of scientists on the voyage to map the seafloor of the Perth Abyssal Plain. The expedition returned to Perth in November after a three-week voyage, bringing with them results that really do ignite the imagination. Looking into the past In the remote waters of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth, scientists aboard RV Southern Surveyor discovered two sunken islands, almost the size of Tasmania, which were once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. In the Cretaceous period when dinosaurs roamed the Earth (more than 130 million years ago), India was adjacent to Western Australia. When India began to break away from Australia, the islands formed part of the last link between the two continents. Eventually these islands, referred to as 'micro-continents' by scientists, were separated from both landmasses and stranded in the Indian Ocean, thousands of kilometres from the Australian and Indian coasts. ""The data collected on the voyage could significantly change our understanding of the way in which India, Australia and Antarctica broke off from Gondwana,"" said Dr Joanne Whittaker, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Sydney's School of Geosciences. Sophisticated instruments Helping the scientists to acquire this data was the suite of Kongsberg Maritime hydroacoustic sensors and systems aboard the RV Southern Surveyor, which included: Simrad EK60 scientific echo sounder Simrad EK500 scientific echo sounder KONGSBERG EA 500 hydrographic echo sounder KONGSBERG EM 300 multibeam hydrographic echo sounder KONGSBERG PS 018 Sub-bottom profiler Travelling on RV Southern Surveyor the scientists discovered the islands through detailed seafloor mapping using the EM 300 multibeam system and by the challenging collection of rocks from the abyss more than 1.5 km below the surface. The collection of the rocks was a key aspect to the mission according to the University of Sydney's Dr Simon Williams, the chief scientist on the expedition, who commented: ""A detailed analysis of the rocks dredged up during the voyage will tell us about their age and how they fit into the Gondwana jigsaw"". The seafloor mapping using the KONGSBERG equipment provided a very clear view of the geology below the surface. The scientists were presented with stunning images of the underwater land masses. This was a vital element of the data that the team brought back with them. ""Our preliminary analysis of the magnetic data that we collected could cause us to rethink the whole plate tectonic story for the whole of the eastern Indian Ocean,"" added Dr. Whittaker. The expedition took place aboard Australia's Marine National Facility's Research Vessel Southern Surveyor, which is owned and managed by CSIRO.

KONGSBERG installs echo sounders on Argentine Navy survey ships,"KONGSBERG installs echo sounders on Argentine Navy survey ships 09 Mar 2007 Kongsberg Maritime has recently completed the installation and commissioning 
of the bathymetric systems onboard the 'ARA Comodoro Rivadavia', and the 'ARA Puerto 
Deseado', two Argentine Navy owned and operated Hydrographic vessels. The upgrades were sponsored by the UNDP (United Nations Development Programs): 
The first through the Environmental Secretary of the Ministry of Health, and the 
second through COPLA (Argentine Commission to determine the Continental Platform 
Limits), of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ARA Comodoro Rivadavia The system installed on the ARA Comodoro Rivadavia is intended for shallow waters, 
and will be used for research and chart production of coastal waters and internal 
rivers. It consists of a two head EM 3000 multibeam, operating at 300Khz with a 
transducer hoisting system, an EA400 single beam operating at 38 and 200Khz, and 
an EA400P on the same frequencies. The system, which also benefits from having a 
Kongsberg Seatex MRU and DGPS positioning unit, was first used on South America`s 
southern channel, the Beagle channel, with great success. ARA Puerto Deseado The ARA Puerto Deseado is equipped with two redundant Kongsberg Maritime single 
beam EA600s, each with two frequencies: 200Khz for shallow waters and 12 Khz for 
depths down to 11000metres. The ship is now specified to fulfil COPLAï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s needs. The installation of the bathymetric equipment onboard ARA Puerto Deseado was 
particularly challenging. An initial installation period of 18 weeks was slashed 
to just 8 weeks due to the vessel being required to sail to the antarctic during 
a good weather window. The vessel has a very important bulb bow and a thruster tube 
in front of the transducers location, making installation more complex than normal 
and COPLA requires a far more stringent checklist, covering third party sensors, 
than that usually encountered by Kongsberg Maritime's ins""Despite several unique challenges, the systems were installed and ready to go 
on time. After leaving the shipyard, all trials showed the high quality of the systems. 
The first surprise was getting marks up to 700 metres with 200Kz operation, in not 
too cold waters and with not very hard bottom. The other surprise was the lack of 
noise in the picture up to 6000 metres, especially with the difficult conditions 
found in the hull,"" comments Torbjorn Kjaer, head of single beam maintenance department

Nova College takes simulator extension,"Nova College takes simulator extension 08 Aug 2005 Nova Contract Opleiding &Training (former Nova College), located in Ijmuiden just 
outside Amsterdam, has purchased an extension to its Inland Waterway (River Ship) 
Simulator with a fourth bridge - (equal to the existing bridges). Extended to meet training needs The 1+3 Polaris Inland Waterway simulator at Nova C. was delivered late 2001 
and will now be extended with bridge no 4 to cover the need for training and examination 
within the inland waterway/river ship industry. High performance mathematical models Polaris Inland Waterway simulators differ from the ""regular"" Polaris Simulator 
primarily on metric values versus nautical (rev. Km/h versus knots) etc. In addition 
the training within river simulation demands very high performance mathematical 
models enabling the right behavior with regards to currents, wind, drift, ship to 
ship interaction, etc., which are also of some importance within ordinary ship handling/harbor 
operations. Increased safety Kongsberg Maritime believes that this extension will be a strong investment equivalent 
to the initial Polaris Inland Waterway simulator in 2001. We are also confident 
that Polaris together with professional users will contribute to increased safety 
within European Waterways. In addition to this simulator, Nova College is also equipped 
with traditional ""Deep Sea"" Polaris Ships bridge simulators and Engine Room simulators. World wide deliveries Kongsberg Maritime has earlier delivered equivalent Inland Waterways simulators 
to training centers in Europe, North America and Asia - the latest delivery was 
to Vietnam. Support program The Kongsberg Maritime simulator equipment at Nova College is covered by the

UiT K-Lander Recovered,"UiT K-Lander Recovered Two K-Lander Systems owned by CAGE (UiT) were recovered from the Barents Sea offshore Svalbard in July and August. Both systems were deployed in October 2016 to collect crucial data to increase the 
understanding of natural seabed methane release in respect to the seasonal sea ice influence on this area. 08 Sep 2017 The two K-Lander Systems include several instruments, which monitored methane release from the seabed to the water column as well as CO2, ocean acidification and circulation. The data from these 
observatories will provide knowledge that will help to understand the processes related to climate change. Both system were equipped with KM Contros HydroC CO2 and CH4 Sensors. Most Sensors logged 
directly in the Data Processing Unit (DPU), which allowed a fast and easy download with already pre-processed data files. For future deployments, acoustic telemetry and modem functionality will be 
added to the existing systems to retrieve status information and stored data from the lander systems while measuring on the seafloor. The already installed Kongsberg cNODEs already support this 
functionality and only a software upgrade is required.

Demand for versatility drives development of sophisticated new Simrad Scientific Echo Sounder,"Demand for versatility drives development of sophisticated new Simrad Scientific Echo Sounder 11 May 2012 Multiple transceivers enable wide range of fixed and mobile applications. The entire echo sounder fits into a small cardboard box: transceiver, power supply, transducer, and cables. A manual is also provided, as well as end user documentation and software on a USB memory 
stick.All you need to add is a PC. Simrad, a division of Kongsberg Maritime AS and the world's leading manufacturer of hydro acoustic products for commercial fishing vessels and scientific research has expanded its market leading scientific 
echo sounder portfolio with the introduction of the new multi-transceiver Simrad EK15. With the ability to connect up to 15 fixed or mobile transceivers by cable or over a wireless network, the new Simrad 
EK15 is suitable for a wide range of applications from fish stock assessment and fish protection to river surveys, environmental monitoring and offshore oil & gas operations. The Simrad EK15 is based on a small and ruggedised single beam transceiver and a dedicated transducer. The operational frequency is 200 kHz, which ensures very high resolution and accuracy. By using 
multiple transceivers in parallel with either simultaneous or sequential pinging it is possible to monitor large areas with only a single echo sounder system. The system can be put to use in a wide variety of environments: lakes, fjords, harbours, shallow marine, rivers, and in aquaculture fish cages for continuous monitoring of fish behaviour, vertical 
distribution of fish, fish escape, food waste and environment. For more than two years, Simrad EK15 prototypes have been put to test by Norwegian industrial aquaculture companies for monitoring purposes. 
The results have been very successful. The Simrad EK15 has also been tested and proven suitable for a number of other critical applications: Hydropower dams ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Fish protection at hydropower dams is critical and an array of EK15 transceivers can create an acoush approaching water inlets. River surveys ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Multiple Simrad EK15 transducers can be used to monitor fish migration and due to the compact size of the system, transport for applications in remote areas is easy. Traditional lake surveys ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The wide opening angle of the EK15 transducer offers a large sampling volume, which enables increased coverage in shallow water environments. Habitat mapping ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The Simrad EK15 can monitor the distribution of vegetation and determine the height of marine growth. In combination with sampling, a vegetation biomass index can be established. Subsea platforms ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The Simrad EK15 due to its small size and low power consumption is well suited for installation into gliders, AUVs, ROVs and ocean observatories. The system can be connected to a standard commercial computer/laptop and supports the Windows ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 7 operating system. Multiple transceivers are connected via a comprovided with a dedicated power supply for AC operation, alternatively 12 V battery supply. The Simrad EK15 can also be 
set up for wireless communication between the computer and the transceivers, which is a good solution for both portable and fixed installation systems as the amount of cabling is greatly reduced. The 
EK15 uses the standard Simrad RAW data storage format supported by 3rd party software analysis tools. This screen capture (in Replay mode) shows the fish in a typical fish cage. The transducer is located in the bottom of the cage looking upwards, and the EK15 has been set in the corresponding mode 
of operation. Up to 15 fish cages can be monitored using a single Simrad EK15 system.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2012/demand-for-versatility-drives-development-of-sophisticated-new-simrad-scientific/

developing DP technology, Kongsberg Maritime still maintains its world leading position as a DP supplier. It's very satisfying that the technology we have worked so hard to perfect was also recently chosen 
as the most important Norwegian engineering accomplishment since the Second World War by the readers of Scandinavia's leading engineering and technology magazine, Teknisk Ukeblad."" ""This technology is unique in the sense that it conquered a large share of the world market, and Kongsberg Maritime has maintained this market position for so long. It is vital that we document this 
history now, since many of those who contributed to the development of the DP technology are getting close to retirement age or have already passed away, and we should honour their work towards making 
maritime operations safer and more efficient,"" adds Morten Breivik, Head of Department of Engineering Cybernetics at NTNU and initiator of the book project. ""The story of the KONGSBERG DP is also an excellent example of how modern cybernetics theory was successfully applied by engineers educated at the department founded by professor Balchen in 1954.

KONGSBERG wins orders for 95 S-VDRs,"KONGSBERG wins orders for 95 S-VDRs 27 Mar 2006 Strong competition Float free storage unit. In competition with ten international contenders, KONGSBERG has signed fleet 
agreements for the supply of simplified voyage data recorders, S-VDR to the entire 
fleets of two large shipping companies. China Shipping has ordered S-VDR for 20 
vessels with an option for an additional 40, to be formally agreed later. Tehran 
based IRISL has ordered S-VDR for their fleet of 34 vessels. In addition the order 
includes an S-VDR system for the IRISL training centre in Tehran. Cost saving installations Both China Shipping and IRISL have their own installation engineers. The fleet 
agreements include training of engineers from both shipping companies. This enables 
them to carry out S-VDR installations and commissioning without assistance by KONGSBERG 
engineer. Fixed or float free storage units KONGSBERG offers fixed or float free storage units with their S-VDR deliveries. 
All the deliveries to China Shipping and IRISL are with float free S-VDR storage 
units. The storage units are made by Jotron Electronics, a company well known to 
ship owners for their rugged and reliable EPIRB. S-VDR and EPIRB in one The KONGSBERG float free storage unit for S-VDR also contains a GPS receiver 
and a type approved EPIRB. Ship owners taking advantage of the dual functionality 
inherent in the float free storage unit, may decommission the existing EPIRB, as 
it in reality becomes obsolete. It is well known that annual survey and battery 
replacement every 5 years are part of the routine maintenance for any EPIRB. The 
same maintenance applies for the float free S-VDR storage unit. Hence, with S-VDR 
and EPIRB in one combined capsule, routine maintenance is the same as for a single 
EPIRB.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2006/kongsberg-wins-orders-for-95-s-vdrs/

crashed in Svalbard, Norway in 2003. The helicopterï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s crew escaped alive, but the wreck had not been seen since it sank into Adventfjorden bay. The wreck is located in shallow waters close to the North shore of the Adventfjorden, where bigger boats are unable to travel. Mark Moline, a professor from California Polytechnic University who is currently a Fulbright Arctic Chair at the University Centre in Svalbard, had been using the REMUS 100 to research 
climate-related changes to the Adventfjordenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ocean floor. When he downloaded the images from an oceanographic survey this September, he discovered th""The wreck is located in shallow waters close to the North shore of the Adventfjorden, where bigger boats are unable to travel,"" Professor Moline said. ""But one reason the REMUS is so useful in our 
research is its ability to navigate through difficult undersea terrain."" REMUS AUVs are renowned for maneuvering in and around unusual oceanographic features with greater ease, and at a lower cost than boats and other submersibles. Professor Moline currently has no 
formal plans to investigate the helicopter wreck further, but he may attempt to explore it again next summer. In addition to his ongoing oceanographic research, Professor Moline also now hopes to use 
the REMUS to locate a German plane that crashed in the Adventfjorden during World War II. ""This is the latest in a series of significant discoveries made using REMUS vehicles,"" said Christopher von Alt, President and co-founder of Hydroid. ""Hydroid is proud to be part of important

Marine Robots Survey D-Day Rehearsal Wreckage for the First Time in History,"Marine Robots Survey D-Day Rehearsal Wreckage for the First Time in History Mission commemorates 70th anniversary of World War II Tragedy 24 Apr 2014 A mission off the coast of South Devon, England has surveyed two U.S. Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs) that were torpedoed and sunk during the D-Day rehearsal Exercise Tiger on April 28, 1944. Using state-of-the-art autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology to collect data from the wreckage site, the mission has produced the first high-definition sonar images of this World War II tragedy. This was the first time in history that an AUV had surveyed the area. GeoSwath scan of LST 531 taken from the REMUS 100. The mission, which was executed by Hydroid, Inc., a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime, with additional data provided by the Royal Navy's Maritime Autonomous System Trials Team (MASTT), commemorates the 70th anniversary of Exercise Tiger. A tragic but largely unknown military operation, Exercise Tiger was a D-Day rehearsal for the invasion of Normandy's Utah Beach. The exercise took place off the southern English coast and resulted in the loss of nearly 1,000 American servicemen - more than the number of deaths at the actual invasion of Utah Beach. The REMUS 100, a Hydroid AUV used for the mission, is designed to perform intricate oceanographic surveys over large areas. The vehicle is equipped with multiple sonar instruments that enable it to capture high-resolution imagery of objects on the sea floor. Using these instruments, Hydroid was able to secure close proximity, high-quality side scan and wide swath interferometric bathymetric multi-beam sonar images of the two LST wreck sites. The data show that both LSTs are about 50 meters below the surface and reach between six to eight meters above the seafloor. The REMUS 100 also discovered an object of interest close to the shore which may hold significance in relation to Exercise Tiger. An effort to identify this object is currently underway by the Royal Navy. REMUS 100 AUV on deck before launching. While Hydroid operated in the English Channel about 30 miles out to sea, MASTT focused on the waters just off Slapton Sands where the Exercise Tiger beach landing took place. The information collected by MASTT's REMUS 100 was an important supplement to the efforts of the Hydroid team. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of Exercise Tiger, Hydroid and the Royal Navy will be donating images obtained from this mission to the UK National Archive and local memorials. ""We hope that the data collected on this mission will shed additional light on this tragic event and help bring some closure to the families who lost their loved ones during Exercise Tiger,"" said Richard 'Bungy' Williams, Regional Manager, Hydroid Europe. ""We are proud to use our technology to honour the memories of the servicemen who lost their lives in this tragic operation."" More Information about Exercise Tiger Exercise Tiger was one of several rehearsal trainings for the D-Day invasion of Normandy's Utah Beach. The exercise took place along the beach at Slapton Sands on the South coast of England, an area chosen due to its similar layout to Utah Beach. On the morning of April 28, 1944, a convoy of eight Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs) was travelling in Lyme Bay heading toward Slapton Sands when they came under attack by nine German torpedo boats. The Germans had been dispatched to investigate heavy radio traffic in the area. LSTs 507 and 531 were hit and sunk. LST 289 was also hit but made it back to shore. In all, 749 soldiers died that night, and 946 in total during Exercise Tiger. It was the most deadly training involving U.S. servicemen during World War II, and more deadly than the actual invasion at Utah Beach weeks later.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/marine-robots-survey-d-day-rehearsal-wreckage-for-the-first-time-in-history/

KONGSBERG demos new shallow water multibeam at Oceanology,"KONGSBERG demos new shallow water multibeam at Oceanology The latest development of Kongsberg Maritime's EM 2040 multibeam echo sounder technology platform is being demonstrated at Oceanology International 2016. The new EM 2040P is a highly 
portable shallow water multibeam echo sounder designed for easy transport and quick deployment on any vessel, while offering survey performance up to and exceeding the IHO-S44 special order and the more 
stringent LINZ specification. 15 Mar 2016 An EM 2040P will be operational on KONGSBERG's Oceanology demo boat, the Northern Wind, which will be running test surveys open to show visitors in the Victoria Dock. Demonstrations, which also feature 
a number of new and existing survey, positioning and communication technologies can be booked on the KONGSBERG Oceanology stand, D600. Both the TX and the RX transducers are combined into one sonar head for ease of installation and integration. Designed for any high resolution mapping and inspection application, the portability of the new EM 2040P enables straightforward delivery and installation on small vessels of opportunity. A key aspect 
of the system is that it features 3 sector transmitters (TX), which allows for active stabilisation for the vessels roll, pitch and yaw. The transmit fan is divided into three sectors pinging simultaneously 
at separate frequencies, which ensures effective dampening of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½multi-bounce interference'. This enables the user to conduct surveys in rough seas and weather conditions, and still maintain full seabed 
ensonification. Both the TX and the RX transducers are combined into one sonar head for ease of installation and integration. The operating frequency range for the EM 2040P is 200 to 400 kHz. The operator can select 
the best operating frequency at any time; 300 kHz for near bottom, 200 kHz for deeper waters, and 400 kHz for very high resolution inspection. New features available on the EM 2040P include Extra Detection, which enables the user to identify, classify and mfloor and in the water column, i.e the shallowest point on 
a shipwreck. The pipe-tracker is another important new feature enabling the system to increase the number of beams and focus on the pipe, which delivers a higher resolution image of the pipe. The EM 2040P is made possible through the development of a new KONGSBERG EM Portable PU (Processing Unit), a ruggedised splash proof processing unit created to work with all KONGSBERG shallow water 
EM-series multibeams. Designed for operation in harsh conditions, the EM Portable PU allows the full feature set of KONGSBERG multibeam technology to be utilised. The basic EM 2040P has three units: A Sonar Head with both the receiver and transmitter integrated, the EM Portable PU and a workstation. Data input from a motion sensor and a positioning system, such 
as the new KONGSBERG Seapath 130, which offers the same portability as the EM 2040P, is required. The sonar head may be delivered mounted on a frame together with the motion sensor and a sound speed sensor,

New research project to investigate sensor fusion and collision avoidance for advanced ships,"New research project to investigate sensor fusion and collision avoidance for advanced ships The Department of Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is leading a new Knowledge-Building Project for Industry that will study collision avoidance 
for advanced ships. The AUTOSEA project is sponsored by the Research Council of Norway with DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics as industry partners. 02 Jun 2015 The Maritime industry has seen an increasing focus on safety and reliability over many decades. Still the accident and casualty rates are high compared to other industries and numerous studies indicate that the majority of these accidents are caused by human errors. Recent advances in self-driving cars and other autonomous systems have shown that it is possible to achieve a high degree of situation awareness and autonomy using advanced sensor technology in combination with cleverly designed algorithms. Using this type of technology on oceangoing vehicles, while keeping the human in the loop, may be a key in reducing these types of accidents. The AUTOSEA project intends to focus on automated situation awareness using sensor fusion to reduce the risk of collisions between ships and vehicles when an increased level of autonomy is introduced. To improve detection capabilities also on small objects and better cover the close-range sector, the AUTOSEA project will, in addition to conventional maritime radar, include sensor types not normally used for such purposes in the maritime sector, like camera, infrared and LIDAR. For the technology to be successful, it will be necessary to resolve conflicts between sensors, and to interpret and support decisions in situations of ambiguity. An increased degree of autonomy on oceangoing vehicles also needs to comply with maritime anti-collision regulations (Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea - COLREGs). ""The last decade has witnessed a substantial progress towards increased autonomy both for land vehicles, aerial vehicles, and underwater vehicles. However, ocean surface vehicles represent a different context and more complex challenges that requires substantial research"", explains Edmund Brekke, Associate Professor at the NTNU's Department of Engineering Cybernetics. ""The primary objective of the research project is to gain competence and knowledge of multisensor data fusion, in order to provide a solid foundation for the qualification of autonomous marine technology."" The project is divided into four areas: sensor fusion, collision avoidance, system architecture and experiments. Sensor fusion involves detection and tracking of moving objects during navigation and manoeuvring using imaging sensors, while collision avoidance will investigate both proactive and reactive methods. System architecture will consider reliability, handling of erroneous data and adaptation of strategies from the automotive and aerospace industries. Experiments will be used to validate and demonstrate COLREGs-compliant navigation and control and assessing detection capabilities using different sensors.

Confidence in KONGSBERG autonomous technology,"Confidence in KONGSBERG autonomous technology The Holy Grail for the commercial sector of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles has always been true standalone autonomous operations, and to attempt a commercial survey under ice requires nothing but extreme confidence. Kongsberg Maritime and Ballard Marine Construction's collaboration with the rental AUV this winter has opened the operational envelope on a commercially deliverable dataset by surveying to hydrographic standards under ice with no support vessel. 07 Mar 2017 Requiring a survey delivering Multibeam, Sidescan and Sub Bottom profiler datasets beneath a frozen lake in North America it was obvious that a smaller vehicle could not contain the required payloads and a larger vehicle would be too difficult to get onto the ice. This made the compact modular design of the AUV perfect; it can be hand carried and mobilised literally anywhere, for example on a frozen lake. Using an air boat, all equipment was brought to the launch site and after only a few hours' assembly the vehicle was ready to be switched on to start mission planning. The aim to launch from an ice hole was challenging, as getting a launch and recovery unit onto the ice was not possible. Instead the operation was started by simply pressing the vehicle down into the water. 20 degrees of pitch at propeller spin up was enough for the vehicle to get into the water and follow the mission plan to conduct the survey. The problem under ice when looking to deliver absolute datasets is the need for accurate navigation. With no ability to surface for a GPS fix and no USBL to aid or update the navigation real time, the need for UTP or single transponder navigation is a necessity. The proprietary algorithm from KONGSBERG allowed the vehicle to navigate whilst still maintaining absolute positioning certainty within IHO specifications. The transponder deployment is very simple; drill a hole in the ice and invert the transponders on a 3 metre pole with a 180 degree beam pattern ensuring no blind zones. The -33 degrees Celsius temperatures meant that the poles were frozen in quickly, ensuring no movement! cNODE Transponder deployment. As a proof check, RTK was used to give the transponder positions. By using standard interrogations it was possible to verify the CNODE range functionality by comparing to the RTK. Incredibly, even over 1.5km the CNODE range matches the RTK position to within 10cm. It is this range accuracy and the blending of KONGSBERG technology that allowed the vehicle to maintain IHO order positioning at all times. With such focus on mission planning it's quite easy to forget the primary role of any vehicle is to carry sensors and as we have come to expect, the KONGSBERG AUV handles this without issue. Logging SBP data alongside Sidescan and Multibeam, a pipeline crossing was surveyed showing both pipeline location and buried depth. In fact, the actual survey equipment and data gathering was the simplest part of the project. Ballard Marine construction, after analysing and checking all data, can provide its end client with high confidence in respect to the pipeline integrity. Recovery was the next challenge. Traditionally, recovery is done using homing beacons but as the vehicle could maintain high accuracy positioning throughout the mission this option was not used, again a credit to the confidence that Ballard Marine had in the vehicle. Simply relying on the vehicle to come back to the ice hole as a simple mission waypoint was initially nerve racking but with each successful mission this extreme mission planning became a simple routine. Getting the vehicle back exactly to a hole no larger than itself seemed initially impossible as it was necessary to estimate the drift and float up time after stopping the propeller. A small recovery ROV was on hand to recover AUV for the last few metres but after some trial and error the vehicle was recovered into the hole with a boat hook. The vehicle was underwater for more than 4 hours, travelling some 30Km. But it came back to the end point within one metre autonomously. And it is with this confidence in our technology that KONGSBERG customers will continue to succeed on challenging projects such as this. Sidescan sonar data. The pipeline burial spread can be clearly identified by the change in backscattering strength. Sub bottom profiler data: This image shows the initial soft sediment layer followed by the first hard return and identifies a pipeline bundle in approximately 4 metres of burial to the left of the image with a single pipeline to the right.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2017/confidence-in-kongsberg-autonomous-technology/
Innovation Meets New Modular Design: The Kongsberg K-Lander Mk2 Seabed Observatory,"Innovation Meets New Modular Design: The Kongsberg K-Lander Mk2 Seabed Observatory In close cooperation with the Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Environment and Climate (CAGE), Kongsberg Maritime deployed two ocean observatories, called K-Landers, offshore Svalbard 
in 2015. CAGE scientists have recently retrieved the long-term observatories that have been deployed on the ocean floor in the Arctic for over a year. 03 Nov 2016 Figure 1. Since the recovery of the CAGE sensor platforms, an innovative effort has been undertaken to further elaborate the design of the K-Lander. With a unique building block concept, consisting of stacking identical support frames to match the needed payload, the K-Lander can be customized and scaled-up to a multitude of long-term subsea monitoring scenarios. The individual modules are then allocated to their specific role in the modular concept (Figure 1): Buoyancy module and communication Payload section (sensors, batteries or a mix of both) Remote-releasable ballast weight Another design feature of the K-Lander is aimed to improve deployment and recovery by implementing the self-floating buoyancy based recovery system. Instead of employing a rope and buoy, the new K-Lander uses a releasable ballast weight system for recovery, making it independent from cost-intensive recovery equipment like ROVs, Dynamic Positioning (DP) requirement for vessel during winching, and one-off recovery rope cartridges. This design maintains the previous specified standard depth rating of up to 2,000 m (Figure 2). Figure 2: The K-Lander has the option to connect up to four stacks for autonomous or cabled deployments. Whether using Kongsberg sensors or additional third party sensors to monitor the K-Lander utilizes a digital processing unit (DPU), which allows for the connection of up to 10 sensors that are powered by a sophisticated power management system (PMU). Customers will greatly benefit from this advantage of managing and controlling sensor operations as well as collecting and pre-processing sensor data directly on the survey site. For example, intelligent algorithms allow for event-based changes in scheduling and switching between sample scenarios or alerts / notifications. The incoming data is computed within the DPU into a comprehensive environmental model rather than plain data logging, making it quicker and more efficient to act on data received. Communication between the K-Lander and the surface is based on the Kongsberg Maritime cNODE technology and the proprietary HiPAP Cymbal acoustic protocol for positioning and data link. These well-established technologies ensure confidence that the K-Lander will continue delivering data while deployed for months to years below the surface. The result of the modular K-Lander Mk2 design is the first standardized, adaptable, and reusable seabed lander solution from the Kongsberg Subsea Monitoring business unit. This approach offers significantly reduced total-cost-of-ownership compared to per-project or custom seabed lander solutions. The team is happy to announce that this design will be available to customers starting in November 2016. CAGE Background Two K-Lander observatories from Kongsberg Maritime were deployed offshore Svalbard in the summer of 2015, in an attempt to unveil the secrets of natural release of the climate gas. These are the sites where flares of gas bubbles have been observed, indicating release of methane gas into the water column.

KONGSBERG supplies custody transfer system for first Chinese built LNG carrier,"KONGSBERG supplies custody transfer system for first Chinese built LNG carrier Milestone Chinese vessel sets sail with K-Gauge onboard. 09 May 2008 Chinese owner Dapeng Sun, the first LNG carrier built in China was delivered to its owner in Shanghai in April, with K-Gauge Custody Transfer System onboard. Dapeng Sun, the first LNG carrier to be built in China was delivered to its owner in Shanghai at the beginning of April 2008, with Kongsberg Maritime's K-Gauge Custody Transfer System (CTS) onboard. The vessel, which has a capacity of 147,000 cubic meters or 70,000 tons, will partly replace foreign flagged vessels currently sailing from Australia to Guangdong Province's Dapeng, China's first LNG receiving terminal. The delivery of Dapeng Sun represents a major milestone in China's shipbuilding history. An LNG vessel requires the highest level of shipbuilding technology since LNG is such a difficult cargo to handle. Until now, very few shipyards, in Japan, the Republic of Korea and some European nations have been capable of building these special-purpose tankers. Dapeng Sun's builders, Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co, are now able to produce LNG tankers on a large scale with four more already on the way, putting China firmly on the LNG carrier map. Technically advanced vessel ""Dapeng Sun is a technically advanced vessel, with the capacity to carry LNG equivalent to one month's use for Shanghai residents,"" comments Kongsberg Maritime's Project Manager in Shanghai, Siri Frï¿½ï¿½ï¿""Co-operation between Kongsberg Maritime in Norway and in Shanghai has ensured that the design and installation of the first CTS in China was a successful operation, which is reflected in the positive feedback we received from the shipyard."" Custody transfer system Installation of the sophisticated K-Gauge CTS commenced in May 2007 and was completed in October 2007 with the final Site Acceptance Test taking place in February 2008. The reliability and accuracy of the CTS is critical to both safety and the efficient trade of LNG around the world. K-Gauge automatically logs LNG tank levels, temperatures and pressure measurements, and calculates the tank volume during the loading-/unloading operation. Loading & unloading reports The system also generates a CTS loading-/unloading report; the official document used for purchasing the gas transported. The unique new K-Gauge flexible report system makes it easy to adapt the system for the changing requirements on the LNG spot market and/or changes in fixed long term Sale and Purchase Agreements, by making it possible to change both the report layout format and the CTS parameters.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/kongsberg-supplies-custody-transfer-system-for-first-chinese-built-lng-carrier/

Hydroid Integrates KONGSBERG's HiPAP with REMUS AUV,"Hydroid Integrates KONGSBERG's HiPAP with REMUS AUV 19 Jan 2011 HiPAP technology will provide REMUS users a faster, more accurate way to obtain the AUV's exact position and to update the vehicle's navigation system. Hydroid, a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime, will now offer the integration of Kongsberg Maritime's High Precision Acoustic Positioning (HiPAP) system into its family of REMUS AUVs. HiPAP 
technology will provide REMUS users a faster, more accurate way to obtain an AUV's exact position and to update the vehicle's navigation system. The REMUS navigation system currently provides an 
accurate real-time estimate of its position, velocity, and heading, which permits the vehicle to autonomously self-navigate and to geographically reference and time stamp all data collected during a 
mission. If desired, the onboard navigation system may be aided by acoustic transponders that are located on the seafloor, or, in shallow waters, aiding may be provided by surfacing and obtaining a 
position update using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Kongsberg Maritime's HiPAP provides an additional means of aiding REMUS' navigation system by transmitting an independently established 
location, which is calculated by the HiPAP system on the surface and then sent to the submerged REMUS vehicle over an acoustic communication link. ""As our customers' trust and confidence in REMUS have grown over the past years, the need to track and communicate with our vehicles during a mission has diminished,"" said Christopher von Alt, 
President and one of the co-founders of Hydroid. ""Today, many owners deploy their vehicles and set them free to execute their mission, returning to recover them six to 24 hours later at a 
pre-programmed location. However, some customers choose to stay in contact with and track their vehicles during a mission. The compatibility of Kongsberg Maritime's HiPAP system with REMUS is of 
interest to both groups."" HiPAP is a family of high precision acoustic position systems based on the Super Short Base Line principle. The system can provide precise 3D position to an acoustic transponder on the vehicle. When combined with heading, pitch, 
roll, yaw and ship position data, the positioning system can support the computation of the vehicle's subsea position in near real time. The HiPAP information is used either to track the vehicle or to update and bind the vehicle's position if it is accurately time-stamped over the acoustic communication link. HiPAP's unique 
transducer technology and advanced digital signal processing form an ideal solution for obtaining an AUV's exact position at any time when it's in range of the ship. The components of a HiPAP positioning system required to support REMUS consist of the surface vessel-mounted spherical acoustic array, the HiPAP processor, and a subsea transponder that is mounted on the REMUS vehicle. ""Hydroid has a proven track record of providing our customers with intelligent solutions for their needs in the field,"" added von Alt. ""To that end, this upgraded capability will offer REMUS users 
a more efficient way of establishing and updating the position of their REMUS vehicles.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/hydroid-integrates-kongsbergs-hipap-with-remus-auv/
Fincantieri selects KONGSBERG hydroacoustic package for new polar research icebreaker,"Fincantieri selects KONGSBERG hydroacoustic package for new polar research icebreaker The new 'RV Kronprins Haakon', the first Norwegian Icebreaker built for Polar research, and the first purpose built polar research vessel since Roald Amundsen's 'Maud' launched in 1917, will start 
regular science cruises in 2017 with a complete hydroacoustic systems package from Kongsberg Maritime. Builder Fincantieri has selected a combined delivery of Kongsberg Maritime survey technology, including 
a wide range of Simrad scientific research systems for the Kronprins Haakon. Kongsberg Maritime will also supply an extensive K-Bridge system, to meet the complex navigation needs of this sophisticated 
new research vessel. 13 May 2015 The new 'RV Kronprins Haakon', the first Norwegian Icebreaker built for Polar research, and the first purpose built polar research vessel since Roald Amundsen's 'Maud' launched in 1917. The building of Kronprins Haakon will start in June this year in Italy. The vessel will be operated by The Institute of Marine Research (IMR) under ownership of the Norwegian Polar Institute. Its homeport 
will be Tromsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in Northern Norway, where its third and biggest user, The Arctic University of Norway (UiT) is based. As one of the most advanced polar research vessels ever built, Kronprins Haakon will 
become integral to gaining a greater scientific understanding of the polar and global environment. The KONGSBERG scope of supply covers deep and medium depth multibeams for bottom mapping including the EM 302, EM 710 and EA 600, while systems such as SBP300 and TOPAS can be used to look at sub bottom 
structures. Position reference will be provided by the state-of-the art and industry standard HiPAP 501 system. Also part of the delivery is the KONGSBERG series of Simrad scientific systems, including 
a new EK80 wideband single beam system, modern scientific multibeam systems ME70 and MS70, and omnidirectional sonars SH90, in addition to the new SU90 that can detect and track biology for several kilohe vessel. Kronprins Haakon will also carry the new Simrad FX80 trawl monitoring system, which can provide a live camera feed from the vessel sampling trawl. Unlike other existing icebreakers the Kronprins Haakon is designed and equipped with acoustics that combined can measure and quantify biology in all components of the marine ecosystem. Quantitative 
multibeam and omnidirectional sonars target areas close to surface and near bottom where traditional echo sounders cannot be used. Also unique to the Kronprins Haakon are the measures taken to secure its ability to collect scientific data both when operating in ice and in open waters. To achieve this, the vessel is equipped with 
two retractable keels that secure an optimal environment for acoustics. However, as the keels cannot be deployed when the vessel is breaking ice, the Kronprins Haakon also carries the full EK80 system 
set flush mount in ice protected arctic tanks, so data can be collected when the vessel is operating in ice. ""The Norwegian Polar Institute is Norway's central governmental institution for scientific research, mapping and environmental monitoring in the Arctic and the Antarctic, and it is important that the 
new vessel can support these functions,"" says ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ystein Mikelborg, assistant project leader for Kronprins Haakon at the Norwegian P""Kronprins Haakon will serve as Norway's main platform for polar 
expeditions for many years to come, and we're confident that it will have the very best instruments available when it becomes operational in 2017.""

KONGSBERG contributes to the worlds first AIS satellite,"KONGSBERG contributes to the worlds first AIS satellite 29 Apr 2010 The Norwegian satellite, AISSat-1 will be launched from India on 9 May. The satellite will be used by maritime authorities as an additional means of ensuring safety at sea in the High North. The satellite as it will appear in space. About AIS All passenger ships and large vessels in international traffic are required to carry automatic ship identification systems, AIS, on board. The AIS system is primarily a ship collision avoidance system and is based on a range of onshore base stations 
with an offshore range of about 40 nautical miles. 35 base stations are deployed along the Norwegian coast and all IMO nations have deployed, or are in the process of deploying, a similar chain of base stations. Benefits of using a satellite based AIS system AISSat-1 is a demonstrator and experimental satellite carrying equipment for reception and relaying AIS signals. Thus expanding the AIS coverage area from coastal waters to all maritime zones controlled by Norwegian Authorities. The exploitation of this technology in a fully deployed system will improve the safety for ocean-going vessels in the High North and around Spitzbergen. Such a system will also simplify the identification and coordination of vessels in a search and 
rescue situation as well as being used for monitoring of vessels carrying hazardous cargo and other environmental risk assessment situations.

New 'Integrated Vessel Concepts' hold key to conserving and generating power on board,"New 'Integrated Vessel Concepts' hold key to conserving and generating power on board 06 Sep 2016 Integration layer harmonises handling, operation and energy functions Concepts combine existing and new technologies to meet specific operational demands Kongsberg Maritime has launched a new portfolio of fully 'Integrated Vessel Concepts' designed to harmonise handling, operations and energy 
systems on a wide range of specific vessel types. The concepts are the product of the company's new 'Integration' strategy, which has been established this summer to leverage existing and new KONGSBERG 
technology to achieve tangible operational efficiency improvements. With its new Integration strategy applied to specific vessels, KONGSBERG has created a new level of integration to enable more dynamics and distributed power management between disparate systems on 
board. The first set of vessels types to receive Integrated Vessel Concept configurations cover a wide spectrum of maritime operations. Vessel types include: Container, Forage Carrier, FPSO, Inspection 
Maintenance & Repair, Research, Ro-Pax, Shuttle Tanker, Small Scale LNG, Superyacht, Trawler and Wind Farm Support. To facilitate Integrated Vessel Concepts, KONGSBERG is further developing its scope of supply to the global shipbuilding industry with focus on electrical systems including switchboards and drives. 
Electrical systems will be fully integrated with on board technology, ensuring optimal power consumption for dynamic vessel operations. With integration between disparate systems, distributed power management, 
data sharing on board and ashore can be significantly approved, facilitating enhanced decision making across the operational chain. Though purposely designed for a broad range of vessel types and customisable to specific requirements, several specific new systems have already been developed for use within KONGSBERG's Integrated 
Vessel Concepts. These include for the first time, the vessel dynamics integrated into the power management layer, providing a new concept for Energy Control. Integrating all elements of the power plant 
to the energy control layer and distributing control functions closer to the consumers with fast acting sensors, redefines the definition of efficiency. Dynamic Load prediction (DLP) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a new DP system to predict power usage for a vessel's thrusters, Dynamic Inertia Control (DIC) and Dynamic Supervision & Control (DSC) are some of the new features enhancing 
energy control for DP (Dynamic Positioning) Operations. Solutions for power plant optimisation include power regeneration using permanent magnetic electric motors for rotating equipment and enhanced battery 
solutions for peak shaving and storage. Examples include systems for vessels with large rotating equipment like winches and electric gangways, which are designed to convert motion into power. Already highly regarded as a maritime technology company through its delivery of extensive i.e. automation, navigation and manoeuvring systems for merchant andBERG is actively 
developing existing partnerships and creating new partnerships with industry leaders to facilitate its new energy and engineering innovations. The company's work in EIT projects forms the basis of its 
expanded energy focused product line, which will be further developed and integrated with more recognisable KONGSBERG technology for automation and operations. ""A primary driver for the development of our Integration strategy and Integrated Vessel Concepts is conservation and predictable utilisation of energy, resulting in lower fuel consumption and the associated 
environmental benefits. However, we also want to create 'free' energy for hybrid or even fully electric power configurations, which are now becoming more viable due to less expensive batteries and more 
sophisticated power management,"" said Srinivas Tati, Vice President, Business Development, Kongsberg Maritime. ""Our approach to integration goes much deeper though. We have studied in-depth how different 
vessels operate to understand how the unification of on board technologies can change how we think about and conduct maritime operations at every level.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/new-integrated-vessel-concepts-hold-key-to-conserving-and-generating-power-on/

HUGIN AUV - best in depth test,"HUGIN AUV - best in depth test 13 Dec 2006 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle - AUV Preparing Hugin 4500 for survey work. ""The HUGIN is better, faster and less expensive than any other semi-submersible. 
It surveys the seabed at half the price and one quarter of the time used by other 
autonomous semi-submersibles,"" according to Dave Alleman of the US offshore survey 
company C & C Technologies. His brother Pete agrees. For C & C Technologies, the HUGIN has been an unmitigated success. About 5 or 
6 years ago, they put their proprietary technology on the back burner and chose 
rather to concentrate on KONGSBERG's HUGIN AUV 3000 (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). 
They have never regretted it. They are currently buying their third HUGIN AUV, a 
HUGIN 4500 that can survey at depths all the way down to 4500 m. HUGIN does it deeper Kongsberg Maritime is the only player on the commercial market that can supply autonomous semi-submersibles to survey the seabed down to a depth of 4500 m. Kongsberg Maritime is the only player on the commercial market that can supply 
autonomous semi-submersibles to survey the seabed down to a depth of 4500 m. ""There are other semi-submersibles, but none that can compete with the HUGIN 
in difficult areas or in waters at depths all the way down to 4500 m. Nor is there 
any other underwater vehicle that can obtain such accurate readings from the seabed,"" 
underlines Pete Alleman, the man in charge of seabed surveying at C & C Technologies. 
The US offshore survey company has used HUGIN to chart the seabed for oil companies 
that operate in West Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, the Mediterranean and Australia. 
""Our job is to survey the seabed where the oil companies plan to build underwater 
installations. With HUGIN's precision measurements, we can give the oil companies 
detailed information about the seabed and conditions there,"" states Alleman. In addition to significantly more accurate mapping facilities, the autonomous 
vessel operates considerably faster. ""What it used to take two to three weeks to survey, we do in five days with HUGIN. 
This helps to increase the efficiency of development projects and seabed installations,"" 
continues Dave Alleman who is responsible for the procurement of the HUGIN 4500. C & C Technologies also uses the vessels to inspect subsea installations once 
they are in place. The Alleman brothers are convinced this will be a growth area 
in the years ahead. More capacity C & C Technologies has cooperated with Kongsberg Maritime on the development 
of the HUGIN 4500. Pete and Dave Alleman have been in Horten this autumn to test 
and pick up C & C's third HUGIN. To make it easier for the customer to maintain 
the vessel, Kongsberg Maritime invited the brothers to take part in the setting 
up and testing. ""Together, we have just conducted a 48-hour test in the waters outside Horten. 
After we corrected the balance of the ballast, the vessel worked perfectly,"" points 
out Karstein Vestgï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rd, manager of the AUV department at Kongsberg Maritime. Not only can the new HUGIN AUV 4500 dive 1.5 kilometres further down to survey 
the seabed at a depth of 4500 m, the technology has also been fu""We have extended battery capacity by 30 per cent and installed more advanced 
sonar and echo sounder systems that feature higher resolution and more precise measurements."" Altogether, HUGIN has surveyed a distance of 120,000 kilometres of seabed for 
offshore survey companies. That is equivalent to sailing around the world at the 
equator about three times over! Vestgï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rd is confident that oceanography and environmental 
surveillance will be new and important markets for HUGIN, with special emphasis 
on ""One important step in the development of HUGIN is that it is geared towards

California Polytechnic State University orders REMUS 600 AUV,"California Polytechnic State University orders REMUS 600 AUV Hydroid Inc. a Kongsberg Company announces that they have recently received an order from the California Polytechnic State University for a custom REMUS 600 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle System - AUV system. The research being conducted by the California Polytechnic State University has been funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the University. 20 Apr 2009 REMUS 600 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle System - AUV system similar to the one being delivered to California Polytechnic State University. The REMUS 600 system presently being manufactured by Hydroid will be modified to house a custom sensor suite, and will incorporate a large battery section to enable very long mission durations, a capability that is key to successfully conducting the research by Dr. Mark Moline and his associates in the Biological Sciences Department. This system will be the third REMUS system owned by the California Polytechnic State University. The previous two REMUS systems were also custom configured to meet their unique research objectives and have been in operation since 2001. Commenting on the recent contract Dr. Moline stated ""We have extensive experience with the REMUS-100 systems, just passing 4,000 km underwater. While these systems continue to be excellent for near coastal applications, their limited duration influences the types of data we can collect and interpretation of the data. For example, we are unable to fully address tidal aliasing in currents, movement of particles etc. The REMUS-600 addresses this issue, but also it allows for a regional snapshot of ocean structure and dynamics. This will allow for near real-time characterization as well as provide ocean models with high density data sets for initialization, assimilation, and/or validation. The depth capability also allows for detailed systematic sampling at depths that cross through the major vertical gradients and out of the euphotic, or lighted, zone of the ocean.""

Revolutionary New Underwater Robot Makes first UK Appearance at Ocean Business,"Revolutionary New Underwater Robot Makes first UK Appearance at Ocean Business 04 Apr 2017 KONGSBERG highlights the disruptive potential of the unique Eelume system Flexible body enables access to hard to reach spaces on underwater infrastructure Kongsberg Maritime is bringing the innovative and ground-breaking new Eelume underwater robot to Ocean Business 2017. A futuristic looking vehicle with a flexible and adaptable body, 
Eelume is designed to live permanently underwater and carry out underwater intervention tasks that would normally require the mobilisation of expensive surface vehicles for divers or to launch and retrieve 
ROVs or AUVs. Visitors to KONGSBERG's Ocean Business stands (N1 & P2) can see how Eelume's unique design allows it to access confined spaces within subsea structures. Its ability to change its shape and hold postures 
allows intricate interactions using a diverse toolset including torque tools, grippers and specialised maintenance equipment. In addition to its superior manoeuvrability, Eelume is a highly stable sensor and actuator platform offering unmatched access to underwater structures for diverse operations. The Eelume solution will 
dramatically reduce costs and the environmental impact associated with having a ship overhead a traditional ROV operation. It can be installed on both existing and new fields where typical jobs include 
visual inspection, cleaning, and operating valves and chokes. These tasks account for a large part of the total subsea inspection and intervention spend. "" As this is the first time that a real-life Eelume system has been shown in the UK, we are expecting it to become one of the major technology highlights at Ocean Business, "" said Richard Mills, 
Sales Director, MaRo, Kongsberg Maritime. "" Eelume is a unique system and we are looking forward to giving visitors a real insight into how the technology has the potential to disrupt the status quo

KONGSBERG develops new Berth Depth Monitoring and Reporting System,"KONGSBERG develops new Berth Depth Monitoring and Reporting System Kongsberg Maritime's Subsea Monitoring (SuMo) and Kongsberg Mesotech have developed an innovative sonar based system that continuously monitors the depth of port berths. Called BDMRS ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Berth Depth 
Monitoring and Reporting System, it puts real-time data about dynamically changing berth conditions into the hands of the people who need it, when they need it. 01 Jun 2016 The system has been developed for integration 
with the KONGSBERG K-Observer fully autonomous monitoring, analysis and reporting system. K-Observer supports the integration of any underwater sensor for continuous and long-term subsea monitoring applications. 
Ports are subject to natural and man-caused conditions that affect the depth of berths and the channel. These causes can be categorized as natural causes and operational causes. Natural causes are water-borne 
solids carried downstream and material driven inland by storm activity. Operational causesing dropped off vessels and docks into the berths, and from operation of thrusters and 
propellers during vessel manoeuvring. As a result, the harbour bottom is continually changing, and it changes randomly. It is essential to know the depth in order for safe port entry and docking, and 
indeed to avoid under loading vessels in berths that are actually deeper than believed. Cross section comparison between two datasets recorded in two weeksï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ time difference. Erosion caused by the vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s thrusters was identified. Port depth monitoring is usually carried out by periodic surveys, which means over time, the published berth depth can differ significantly from the actual depth. This can be over- or under-estimated 
when stakeholders apply a factor of safety, which increases over time. The result is, essentially, a berth can be much deeper than the last data shows. Considering that each centimetre of additional draft 
equates to 150 tonnes of additional product s to see that accurate up to the minute berth depth data can have significant revenue benefits for both the 
operating company and the port facility. Not to mention the safety and environmental benefits of mitigating the risk of vessel groundings. Recorded Point cloud data of the seabed in the port of Hamburg. The BDMRS uses DAS sonars to acquire profile data of the berth bottom adjacent to the instrumented section. The frequency of data collection can be defined by the user's needs - continually, hourly, 
daily, weekly, or on-demand. The data is then uplinked to the monitoring station using a suitable telemetry link. The result of each scan is a point cloud representation of the channel-bed at the scan 
time. From the K-Observer system, the data available in the 3D point cloud can be generated to produce 3D grids, cross sections and volume differences between the grids at various scan times and a summary 
report can be generated/printed. The data generated is real-time, persistent depth monitoring data that enhances marine charts and tide data. This data can be presented in a simple Graphic User Interface 
which in turn can be accessed by users to make operational decisions. The KONGSBERG BDRMS is a new application of proven technology with over 10 years of field history. It is cost effective and simple to operate. It is installed, commissioned, inspected, maintained and 
supported both locally and remotely. It supports Port Operations, and assists Disaster Response and Recovery after major storm events. Operators can then use the accurate, up-to-date data to make better,

Now Kongsberg Maritime launches the new Simrad Autonomous EK system with cutting edge technology to 
carry out continuous long term, in-depth ecosystem monitoring of the subsea environment. The Simrad Autonomous EK system uses wideband echo sounding technology to discriminate between plankton and different 
fish species producing high-quality, high resolution scientific data. 02 Jun 2015 The Simrad Autonomous EK system uses wideband echo sounding technology to discriminate between plankton and different fish species producing high-quality, high resolution scientific data. The system is a fully autonomous echo sounder unit built using the same wideband technology as the latest high precision, scientific wideband echo sounder, the Simrad EK80. The battery technology and 
pg Maritime technology used in the oil and gas industry for decades, where duration and safety is of the highest concern. Whereas traditionally multiple 
echo sounders working in parallel on different frequencies were needed to discriminate between marine species, the wideband technology used in the Simrad Autonomous EK system allows for transmission on 
frequencies from 35 to 500kHz , depending on the transducers used in the system setup. With 4 independent channels and internal multiplexing, a wide combination of split beam or up to 8 single beam transducers 
can be interfaced to the system. The Simrad Autonomous EK system contains features such as low power consumption and an energy saving sleep mode allowing it to be deployed on the seabed for more than a year operating autonomously 
with internal logging. A new mission planner software has been developed as part of the system, allowing for a pre-programmed customised mission plan. The wideband frequency sweep (chirp) in combination 
with advanced signal processing gives exceptionally good signal to noise ratio and range resolution. These new features assist scientists with ecosystem monitoring enabling them to identify species more 
accurately. The Simrad Autonomous EK system has been developed in conjunction with leading marine institutes with testing carried out by scientists in the Shelikof Strait in the Gulf of Alaska, where three unites 
were moored to the seafloor for a period of three months to record the passage of fish above them. ""The data looked beautiful,"" said Alex De Robertis, a biologist with the Alaska Fisheries Science Centre, the research branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine 
Fisheries Service in a recent NOAA press release. Scientists from NOAA have used acoustics for many years to set sustainable catch limits for the Walleye Pollock, but until now this has been done from 
research vessels. ""This was a first trial. Usually we estimate how many fish we have by reading the acoustic echo off their backs. In this case, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be reading the "" ""The Autonomous EK system is entirely new in the Simrad product portfolio.

AutoChief C20 automation system For 120k dwt product tankers Bearing wear monitoring system sensors. Kongsberg Maritime has been selected to supply its Bearing Wear Monitoring system 
for a series of eight advanced 120k dwt product tankers presently under construction 
at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries in Mokpo, South Korea for the Norwegian ship owner 
KGJS. Delivery of these sophisticated solutions is from May 2009 through 2010. Monitors bearings in large two stroke diesel engines The Bearing Wear Monitoring system is designed to monitor wear down of bearings 
in large two stroke diesel engines. It provides an early warning in the form of 
an alarm should any of the three crank-train bearings (crosshead, crank and main 
bearings) get unexpected wear problems during operation and thereby enable the crew 
to carry out preventative maintenance, avoid unscheduled maintenance, reduce off-hire 
and ultimately cost. Standalone or integrated The system may be delivered standalone or integrated into Kongsberg Maritime's 
K-Chief 500 marine automation and AutoChief C20 propulsion control automation systems. 
In the case of the Jebsen newbuildings, the BWM system is connected to the AutoChief 
C20 system via the common (CAN) network. The system uses the Bearing Wear Monitoring 
mimic to display wear and trending measurements. Optimal engine overhaul intervals The tankers will be powered by HHI MAN B&W 6S70ME-C M8 main engines, which are 
fully electronically controlled and monitored. The Bearing Wear Monitoring system 
will be installed by engine builder HHI-EMD in Korea. The Owners consider the Bearing 
Wear Monitoring system as logical step in order to introduce a proactive maintenance 
system and ensure optimal engine overhaul intervals. The open architecture of the Bearing Wear Monitoring system provides the opportunity 
to add additional engine monitoring systems, such as bearing temperature and cylinder 
liner temperature. In addition to using a reliable technical solution that can provide a reduction 
in maintenance costs and downtime aboard its eight newbuildings, Jebsen will also 
benefit from Kongsberg Maritime's extensive world wide service organisation, which 
will ensure the highest possible system availability regardless of where in the

A Mountain of Success for Kongsberg Maritime Sponsored 'Spirit of Singapore' Expedition,"A Mountain of Success for Kongsberg Maritime Sponsored 'Spirit of Singapore' Expedition As a premiere sponsor of the three-man 'Spirit of Singapore Climbing expedition', which took place on the remote Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia, 2 nd ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 19 th August 2009, Kongsberg Maritime has received the honour of having a virgin peak named after it. 31 Aug 2009 David Lim, Grant Rawlinson and Mohd Rozani on top of the Kongsberg peak. Climbing virgin peaks offers a unique set of challenges to the mountaineer, a high level of risk and uncertainty of success... The expedition team consisted of David Lim, team leader and motivational coach who suffers from Guillain Barre Syndrome, which has left him partially disabled, Mohd Rozani, a high access ropes technician and Grant Rawlinson, Sales Manager at Kongsberg Maritime, Singapore. The aim of the expedition, which was the result of over 3 years meticulous planning, preparations and training, was to climb as many unclimbed mountains as possigsberg Peak The previously unnamed Kongsberg Peak was the first of three that the team successfully climbed and claimed names for. From the Karkara basecamp set at 2000m in the south eastern corner of Kazakstan, the team members were airlifted 90km into the mountains, courtesy of a Kyrgystan army MI-8 helicopter to 3950m elevation, high on the Mushkatova Glacier. Here they set up basecamp and spent 2.5 days acclimatising and performing reconnaissance before the first summit was chosen, an unnamed, unclimbed peak showing at 4550m on the only available large scale map of the area. On the morning of Friday 7 th August 2009, the team climbed for 7 hours up steep rock and scree slopes to a broad snowy ridge which led directly onto the summit of a beautiful mountain peak. Being the first known human beings to stand on the summit, the team decided to name the peak 'Kongsberg Peak' in honour of the premier expedition sponsor. Since then, the mountain peak's name has been registered with the Kazak and Kyrgystan mountaineering federation who have also confirmed that it was previously unclimbed. Handheld GPS readings taken on the summit show Kongsberg Peak's position as: N 42d18'47.2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ E 79d57'45.0ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Height =4551m Onwards and Upwards Over the next ten days, the team attempted three more previously unclimbed peaks and were successful in scaling two of them, which they named Resilience Peak (4447m) and Majulah Peak (5152m). The name Malujah Peak reflects the spirit of the expedition and indeed Kongsberg Maritime's sponsorship of it. 'Majulah' is a Malay word meaning 'onwards' or to 'forge ahead'.

The bathymetry is the baseline for long term studies. Note the dredge marks caused by the sea ice processes. Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Boris Radosavljevic. A stark seasonal contrast characterizes coastal dynamics on arctic coasts. During the winter the coast is protected by sea and landfast ice. In absence of ice the coast is exposed to mechanical and 
thermal erosion processes with high erosion rates. Forecasts of many climate change models indicate that the Arctic region will experience disproportionate warming in coming decades, which will further 
increase the rate of coastal erosion and also liberate vast quantities of carbon stored in permafrost leading to an important potential climate feedback, as the carbon released from permafrost might contribute 
further to the warming trend. The research project looks to describe and quantify the erosion and related carbon release by using air- and space- born methods together with field research. Herschel Island in the Beaufort Sea, Yukon 
Territory, Canada, was selected as a natural laboratory for the long term field study. An integral part of the fieldwork is seafloor mapping for which AWI has chosen the Kongsberg GeoAcoustics GeoSwath Plus Compact system. The system delivers high resolution bathymetry with coverage 
of up to 12 times the water depth in this shallow water environment and co-registered geo-referenced side scan data, which can be used for detailed seafloor classification. In the 2012 field season c. 3.1 km 2 has been collected, mapping Pauline Cove with water depth of 1 - 17 m in five short survey days. This dataset represents a baseline to which future surveys 
can be compared to. Future expeditions are planned to re-survey and expand the area to other parts of the island. Decisive factors in operating in remote and harsh environments are the portability and reliability of the equipment. The remote location makes it necessary to airlift all equipment and personnel.

KONGSBERG equipment charts the Mekong River,"KONGSBERG equipment charts the Mekong River In 2007 the Royal Thai Navy purchased three EM 3002 Dual head shallow water multibeam echosounder systems (now available as the more modern EM 2040) for installation on three brand new survey motor launches built specifically for the task of charting the Mekong River. 10 Dec 2008 The Royal Thai Navy has purchased three EM 3002 Dual head shallow water multibeam echosounder systems for installation on three brand new survey motor launches. The Royal Thai Navy, Hydrographic Department, has embarked on an ambitious project using three EM 3002D multibeam echosounder systems to accurately chart the river to allow greater safety of navigation through the river channel. Key personnel involved in the project, Admiral Congvat Neelasri and Director General and Captain Taywan Sukkasem mentioned that the information will also be beneficial for water resource management and studying the river's behaviour for erosion prevention. The first phase of the charting process has already taken place with all EM 3002D system working very effectively. The survey conditions prove to be a very demanding environment, with high current flows and turbid water conditions. Because of the very shallow water depths, dual head systems were chosen to give maximum swath widths with accurate bathymetry (to IHO special order 1 category) out to 10 x water depth. About the Mekong River The Mekong River stretches 4,200 kilometers and is the tenth largest river system in the world. Beginning in the mountains of Tibet, the Mekong flows south into China's Yunnan Province, where it drops more than 4,000 meters and emerges into an alluvial delta that spans the Golden Triangle where Laos, Burma and Thailand meet. The river courses through Laos forming a border with Thailand, then flows through Cambodia including its capital Phnom Penh before culminating in the Vietnam delta and the South China Sea. The Mekong River has long been a source of political tension between countries it runs through. This is due to environmental issues such as dam's being built along the river, pollution and water levels.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/kongsberg-equipment-charts-the-mekong-river/

Preparing for launch of the Hugin 1000 autonomous underwater vehicle. Photo: Turid Astrid Reksten. The search team at work. For nearly two weeks, the Norwegian Navy has been searching for the airplane of the Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen, missing since 18 June 1928. Kongsberg Maritime's HUGIN 1000 has been the main search tool for the job, covering an area of 35 square nautical miles north west of Bear Island (Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ya) where the airplane was assumed to have gone down. Last week, the expedition team returned to Tromsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, confirming that the airplane engine is not to be found in the searched area. Although somewhat disappointed by the outcome, the Norwegian Navy ""HUGIN 1000 performed perfectly throughout this expedition. To us, the most important thing was not necessarily the outcome, but being able to perform this expedition and to test HUGIN 1000 in arctic waters"", commented Lieutenant Commander, Helge Stian Telle of the Norwegian Navy. Two possible theories During six pre-planned missions, HUGIN was sent out to map the seabed for approximately 14 hours at a time. Equipped with synthetic aperture sonar, HUGIN 1000 provides high resolution acoustic imagery with a resolution of 3 x 3 centimeter, making it a highly suitable tool in the search for a small airplane engine approximately three metres long. The data collected by HUGIN was analysed and narrowed down to a list of 15-25 targets of interest, which were investigated further by an ROV. Several matches were found with the measurements of the Latham engine, but upon further investigation, these turned out to be noting but stones, trawl doors and whale skeletons. Expedition leader Rob McCallum gives two possible theories why the airplane was not found. ""One possibility is that the fishing boat captain, who made the first findings in 1933 forming the basis of this search, miscalculated its location. Another explanation is that trawlers might have taken or destroyed the wreckage completely"", he said. No future searches The search marks the final chapter in the long battle to locate the Latham engine. The driving force behind the reopening of the search, Mr. Kjell Lutnes of the Norwegian Aviation Museum says that there are no further searches planned. ""We did what we had to do, which was to follow in the steps of Amundsen and the Latham 47. Now we can be sure that the airplane is not in this area, and there will be no more searches in the future"", he said.

installation on the pelagic trawl fleet of the Karnaphuli River in Chittagong, Bangladesh. 19 Jan 2017 The project took place during October and November 2016, and included installation of eight SX93 low frequency fish finding sonars. The system is part of the SX90 family of long range, high 
resolution, low frequency fish finding omni sonars, used for searching and catching schooling fish as well as scattered fish in up to 8000m in any direction from the vessel. Five FS70 third wire trawl sonars, which monitor the trawl opening of a pelagic trawl, were also installed. Communication is through a cable between the trawl and the vessel. The sonar unit is 
placed on the top of the opening of a mid water trawl, and will show the opening itself as well as fish entering. When the trawl is filled with the required amount of fish, catch sensors placed on the 
cod end (very aft end) of the trawl will provide an alarm through an acoustic link. Several vessels in the fleet also had ES70 echo sounders and Simrad TV80 wireless trawl instruments installed. 
The ES70 is a fish finding echo sounder with up to 6 simultaneous frequencies, capable of finding single fish down to 1200m. Using split beam transducers, it will show fish size distribution, helping 
the user determine the fish species. The Simrad TV80 Catch Monitoring system is wireless and can be used with a variety of acoustic sensors. All these sensors can be placed on a trawl or purse seine to simultaneously monitor key 
parameters. Typical parameters are depth of net or trawl, net or trawl door height over seabed, roll/pitch angle of trawl door, distance between trawl doors, and fish filling of trawl. After finalising the above installations, sea trials and operator training was performed during ordinary fishing in the Bay of Bengal.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2017/global-co-operation-for-bangladesh-trawl-fleet-sonar-installation/

Remora HiLoad DP completes final sea trials with KONGSBERG Dynamic Positioning in Control,"Remora HiLoad DP completes final sea trials with KONGSBERG Dynamic Positioning in Control 10 Feb 2011 State-of-the-art Integrated Automation System and DP System supports unique HiLoad concept. State-of-the-art Integrated Automation System and DP System supports unique HiLoad concept. The 27th January 2011 was a milestone in the development of the unique Remora HiLoad DP as it completed its final sea trials before live field implementation. HiLoad is a revolutionary deepwater offshore 
loading terminal, made possible by innovative vessel design and the use of a cutting-edge Kongsberg Maritime Integrated Automation System (IAS). Built at the Aibel Shipyard, Haugesund, Norway, HiLoad is the first vessel in a new generation of generic offshore loading systems that through state-of-the-art technology, including Remora's patented 
HiLoad Attachment System and Kongsberg Maritime's IAS; which includes K-Pos Dynamic Positioning, K-Chief marine automation, K-Bridge, and fire, safety, and emergency shutdown system; can control the position 
of a standard oil tanker that does not have its own thrusters or DP system. This mobile system can be deployed at any field and used for the safe and efficient transfer of oil from an FPSO to any size 
and type of tanker, effectively replacing the need for a shuttle tanker. The K-Chief automation system aboard HiLoad monitors and controls the Ballast, Power Management, Thruster Control, Machinery and bilge system. There are approx 2500 I/O (signals) with Field stations 
placed around the ship connected to each other and the operator stations on the bridge via redundant network. The IAS includes custom automatic ballast sequences for docking and undocking of a tanker, 
which are based on predefined sequences of valve and ballast pump operation, with back pressure automatically controlled via integrated PID controllers. The K-Pos Dynamic Positioning system controls the position of HiLoad when alone and when connected to an oil tanker loading oil behind a FPSO. Because the application is brand new, Remora and Kongsberg 
Maritime had to develop several unique processes for the DP system. ""Early in the project several big challenges that needed special attention were identified,"" comments Pï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½l Borge Korneliussen, Group Manager, Application / DP & Manoeuvring Offshore, Kongs""The size of the tankers can vary from Aframax to VLCC and because of this range we needed to develop a method for calculating the hydro dynamic model for the different oil tankers. We also had to consider 
the massive change in displacement when HiLoad connects to a tanker. ""The most challenging operation for the HiLoad is connecting or disconnecting the oil tanker. For the final sea trial using the Aframax tanker SKS Tana we implemented local reference systems between 
the HiLoad and the Oil tanker; Kongsberg Maritime's own RADius and a Fanbeam system. This gave HiLoad the possibility to determine the heading and the position of the oil tanker relative to itself. A 
modified Follow Target function made the approach towards the oil tankers safe. ""The size and shape of HiLoad is unique so there was a significant effort to establish the correct parameters. All in all the final 21 day sea trial was successful for the customer and for the Kongsberg 
Maritime systems aboard HiLoad,"" continues Korneliussen. ""There were a number of obstacles and challenges during the project period, but through good communications, resource management and highly skilled engineers Kongsberg Maritime has made a successful 
delivery to support a cutting-edge concept that can provide tangible improvements for offshore operations,"" adds Project Manager Glenn Edvardsen. The DNV approved HiLoad DP is the first of a planned series of HiLoad vessels. (Approximately) 13 oil companies representing the majority of the world's oil production observed the sea trials and have 
shown interest in using the system.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/remora-hiload-dp-completes-final-sea-trials-with-kongsberg-dynamic-positioning/
New KONGSBERG multibeam installation passes SAT,"New KONGSBERG multibeam installation passes SAT Multibeam echosounders enhance capabilities of one of the most advanced privately owned survey vessels. 16 May 2008 Multibeam echosounders enhance capabilities of one of the most advanced privately owned survey vessels. Global Seas owned R/V Mt. Mitchell, one of the best privately-owned vessels with capability to perform seabed mapping to full ocean depth. R/V MT. Mitchell, a Seattle based survey vessel first commissioned in 1968 has been fitted with the latest cutting-edge Kongsberg Maritime multibeam system, which passed a Site Acceptance Test (SAT) in April 2008. The newly installed EM 120 and EM 710 were supplied by Kongsberg Maritime subsidiary, Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc., based in Lynnwood, Washington. The R/V Mt. Mitchell had been in service as a hydrographic survey ship with NOAA. She was completely refurbished and updated by Global Seas and put back into service in 2004. This significant modernization, to the highest SOLAS, ABS and USCG standards, provides an unmatched environment for ship crew and scientific researchers. She is capable of meeting all relevant survey standards including those of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The EM 120 and EM 710 make the R/V Mt. Mitchell one of the best privately-owned vessels with state-of-the-art capability to perform seabed mapping to full ocean depth with an unrivalled resolution, coverage and accuracy. With its new systems, the R/V Mt. Mitchell is able to map the deepest oceans in the world, surveying in waters down to 11,000 meters. For shallow water surveying, in less than 11 meters, the R/V Mt. Mitchell deploys a 34 foot, twin diesel engine launch. In addition to the new multibeam installation, a 20"" hull sea chest has been installed to accommodate a Kongsberg Maritime High Precision Acoustic Position System (HiPAP) for tracking towed sidescan, ROV and AUV and other through-hull sensors for scientific work can also be deployed. This summer the R/V Mt. Mitchell will be putting its new multibeams to use collecting data for Terrasond Surveys of Palmer, Alaska and conducting nautical charting surveys of the Cook Inlet. She is also expected to work with UTEC Survey, Inc., a Houston corporation, mapping a cable route along the West Coast of the United States.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/new-kongsberg-multibeam-installation-passes-sat/

Kongsberg Maritime has developed a new system for measuring sea current speed and direction at given points on a drilling riser, which can be integrated with its sophisticated High Precision Acoustic Positioning and underwater navigation system, HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ . The new Sea Current Meter and HiPAP package is designed to improve control of drilling operations and has already been delivered to the first user. The Sea Current Meter package consists of a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) interfaced to a telemetry transponder, which sends the 3D sea current data via acoustics to the onboard HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ system. There are virtually no limits to the number of sea current packages that a single rig me to receive accurate current data from as wide an area as required. The Kongsberg Maritime development team has accounted for the fact that sending sea current telemetry takes time, which will influence the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ update rates. However sea current does not change in direction or speed over short periods of time, so the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ DVL update rate can be set to read current data only every 5 to 30 minutes, therefore mitigating impact on the update rates and ensuring integrity of position data.

KONGSBERG successfully completes autonomous operation of coastal cargo ship as part of EUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,"KONGSBERG successfully completes autonomous operation of coastal cargo ship as part of EUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s AUTOSHIP project Kongsberg Maritime has successfully demonstrated a range of remote and autonomous technologies on a cargo vessel operating off the coast of Norway. The test cruise has been named one of the most complex autonomous journeys at sea so far. 26 May 2023 Text: Kongsberg Maritime The Eidsvaag Pioner , is one of the two vessels that are equipped for remote-operated and autonomous transport demonstrations for the AUTOSHIP project, which is part of Horizon 2020, an EU research programme. Owned by the Eidsvaag shipping company, the Eidsvaag Pioner operates along the Norwegian coast and in fjord areas where it carries fish feed to ocean fish-farms. The demonstration was carried out over 13 hours and involved the vessel completing a voyage outside the coast of Kristiansund on the northwest coast of Norway. The ship undocked from the port of Averï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½y, sailed to the worldï¿½m again, a journey of about 160 nautical miles in total. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This was an opportunity to show the world that remote and autonomous technologies can be successfully deployed on a general cargo vessel, carrying out a range of operational aspects of a typical voyage. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ CEO of KONGSBERG, Geir Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½y ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There has been great collaboration between all partners in the AUTOSHIP project, and we have all been impressed with how the Eidsvaag Pioner performed under remote control and during autonomous sailing and docking. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Today we have demonstrated a range of the key enabling technologies that will lead the way towards routine remote and autonomous operation in the years ahead.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ What was demonstrated The demonstration was initiated, managed and monitored by the crew from the Kongsberg Remote Operating Centre (ROC) on land in ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lesund. It involved a mix during the test cruises. The first part of the demonstration included automatic undocking from the quay at Averï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½y. The autonomous technology then took control to navigate and manoeuvre out of the harbour and further out to open sea. Here the ship navigated a route between several islands and avoided other sea traffic, before arriving at the offshore fish farm Ocean Farm 1 , owned by Salmar. Various manoeuvres were then carried out using the Dynamic Positioning (DP) system. The vessel next returned to port, again navigating open sea and congested seaways before it automatically docked again. The entire operation was monitored and occasionally controlled remotely by the shore-based captain and engineer. During the demonstration, a number of established and new KONGSBERG technologies were deployed, and included Auto-undocking and Autodocking, Situational Awareness System, Autonomous Navigation System, Intelligent Machinery System, Connectivity & Cyber ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½x Positioning. Cloud-based communication systems and advanced simulations have also been involved to test and ensure that the vessel operated safely and optimally.

First field results for the HISAS Synthetic Aperture Sonar,"First field results for the HISAS Synthetic Aperture Sonar 30 Aug 2005 Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) combines a number of acoustic pings to form an image that is typically 10 times higher resolution than conventional sonars. Advanced signal processing The HISAS sonar is part of the HUGIN system solution for mine counter-measures, which has been ordered recently by the Norwegian Navy. HISAS is a wideband SAS sonar with frequency range of 70-100kHz, capable of producing ultra high resolution acoustic 
images as well as co-registered bathymetry. The sonar is tightly integrated with the INS navigation and motion sensing platform of the HUGIN AUV, and makes use of modern signal processing such as DPCA (Displaced Phase Centre Analysis) to process the raw data into images. High resolution The sonar prototype has recently been tested with success at sea outside Horten - Norway, with signal processing done by FFI. The image above is from this test and shows a sunken wreck standing upright on the bottom. It has a resolution of about 4 cm both along track and across and each acoustic beam being processed from 
40 consecutive pings. Resolution is high enough so that one can observe details such as the wire running from the bow to the top of the mast. Principle The principle of synthetic aperture sonar is to move a sonar along a line and illuminate the same spot on the seafloor with several pings. This produces a synthetic array equal to the distance travelled. By coherent reorganization of the data from all the pings, a synthetic aperture image is produced with improved along-track resolution. SAS processing have the potential to improve the resolution by one order 
of magnitude compared to conventional sidescan sonars.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2005/first-field-results-for-the-hisas-synthetic-aperture-sonar/

Energy storage systems will be supplied by Echandia directly to the owner, while Oresund Drydocks will handle the mechanical conversion. Installation company SH-Group will produce and install deck houses and ensure that cabling is routed the right way and that the new equipment will be installed and wired. The rapid conversion job is scheduled to start in November 2025 at Oresund Drydocks, but the vessel will be visiting the yard in March during scheduled maintenance docking for preparation work before operating the summer season and then undergoing conversion. The conversion will enable emission-free operation with powerful battery packs for each of the four thruster motors. The thrusters will be powered by the electric motors, with the existing diesel engines as a backup. The ferry route between Helsingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½r, and Helsingborg across the northern and narrowest part of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½resund strait, is one of the world's busiest international car ferry routes. With the MF Hamlet's conversion, the entire route will be fully electric. Kongsberg Maritime's scope will include the conversion of the top gear on the four US 3001 Controllable Pitch thrusters, rebuilt to have twin input, where the primary input is driven by the new electric permanent magnet motors and the secondary is connected to the existing diesel engines. The ferry will charge its batteries shoreside connecting to the existing charging robots (10.6 MW/10.4 kV). The ferry will also be prepared to install Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Auto-Crossing and Auto-Docking technology to automate transit and harbour manoeuvres.

KONGSBERG demonstrates potential for improved navigation and positioning,"KONGSBERG demonstrates potential for improved navigation and positioning 23 May 2007 Enhanced navigation and positioning The demonstration took place on a research vessel owned by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Kongsberg Seatex, the position reference division of Kongsberg Maritime, hosted 
a MARUSE demonstration at its premises in Trondheim, Norway on May 9 th 2007. The 
company invited MARUSE project partners, customers and Norwegian press, in order 
to demonstrate the possibilities for greatly enhanced navigation and positioning 
using already available signals and the new Galileo satellites. The first MARUSE demonstration in 2007 The MARUSE project was created to address topics such as security and safety, 
integrity, continuity, availability and accuracy through the use of the forthcoming 
Galileo satellite constellation. The project, which consists of leading satellite 
navigation companies from all over Europe is within the EU 6 th Framework Programme 
for Research and Technology Development and is part funded by the GNSS Supervisory 
Authority (GSA). The Kongsberg Seatex demonstration was the first of four public 
MARUSE demonstrations in 2007, all of which are aimed at demonstrating future Galileo 
performance for the maritime community. As the project leader/coordinator of MARUSE, Kongsberg Seatex demonstrated the 
vital role in the future requirements for maritime navigation that MARUSE will play. 
The day started with presentations by Kongsberg Seatex and MARUSE project partners, 
describing the scope of possibilities that Galileo and the Global Navigation Satellite 
System (including GPS, Glonass and SBAS) represents. Improvements in relative positioning The demonstration itself took place on a research vessel owned by the Norwegian 
University of Science and Technology, and concentrated on the improvements in relative 
positioning that have been achieved through MARUSE research. In order to demonstrate 
this, the positioning system onboard - which was based upon a newly developed Seatex 
Maritime User Terminal interfaced to other sensors - tracked a transponder on the 
quayside in Trondheim whilst sailing a short route around the Trondheims fjord. Demonstrating the accuracy and integrity The equipment performed extremely well, demonstrating the accuracy and integrity 
that had been explained throughout the day. The demo system has been developed based 
on the single Galileo test satellite in orbit - GIOVE A -and a combination of EGNOS, 
GPS and Glonass signals. Existing satellite constellations and thorough simulations 
have proved that significant enhancements in position accuracy and signal availability 
can be expected with Galileo. Will easily adapt to Galileo ""The demonstration provided partners and customers with an insight into a forthcoming 
technology platform, that will easily adapt to Galileo when the full signals become 
available,"" comments Arne Rinnan, technical director at Kongsberg Seatex. ""The system 
combines all available signals to ensure the best operation, as proven during today's 
demonstration. When we add Galileo signals to the mix, quality of service will immediately 
be raised including accuracy and availability of navigation and positioning signals.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/kongsberg-demonstrates-potential-for-improved-navigation-and-positioning/

In the wake of last yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s successful pilot trials, conducted with the assistance of offshore service provider BOURBON Offshore ( https://bit.ly/3f8zGyU ), BV and Kongsberg Maritime have been working in close collaboration to leverage the insights derived from the initial installation. BV is now allowing vessel owners and operators to conduct DP Annual trials using the DPDS application. Kongsberg Mahe DP Annual tests, carried out in accordance with IMO MSC Circ 1580 guidelines and IMCA M 190, to verify the performance and redundancy of the vessel-specific DP system. This encompasses the complete installation necessary for dynamically positioning a vessel, comprising, but not limited to, the following sub-systems: power system, thruster system and DP control system. Running on a validated, industrial data recording and management platform that provides incomparable data quality and consistency, the KM DPDS application provides access to data acquired directly from the DP system. The data is transferred to class surveyors via KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s secure cloud infrastructure upon completion of the trials. The surveyor can then play back the DP Annual trial program onshore, based on the high-quality DP data accumulated. Each test is unique and can be played back individually. Surveys can be carried out at any time from any location once the data is uploaded to the KM cloud.

In response to the growing regulatory pressures on emissions and fuel efficiency, Kongsberg Maritime, together with Deltamarin, has developed a vessel design that demonstrates compliance with future regulations is achievable even when using conventional fuels. This new design promises fuel cost savings between 40-50% depending on the operational profile, addressing a crucial industry need. ""While low-carbon fuels are an option, many prefer to stick with conventional fuels. Our goal was to design a vessel capable of complying with predicted CII regulations throughout its lifetime, using advanced energy-saving technologiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Oskar Levander Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Kongsberg Maritime Oskar Levander, Vice President of Strategy and Business Development at Kongsberg Maritime, explains, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Ship owners face significant challenges in meeting tighter regulations. While low-carbon fuels are an option, many prefer to stick with conventional fuels. Our goal was to design a vessel capable of complying with predicted CII regulations throughout its lifetime, using advanced energy-saving technologies.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The vessel's system integrates a Hybrid Shaft Generator with frequency control, optimising electrical power usage and reducing emissions, while supporting increased loads from wind-assist technologies and air lubstudy, Kongsberg Maritime selected a Kamsarmax bulker of 82,000 DWT, a common vessel size globally, as the basis for the new design. The Kamsarmax represents a versatile choice as this vessel type often faces restrictions with the global availability of low-carbon fuels, making it an ideal candidate for the study. Collaborating with ship designers Deltamarin, Kongsberg Maritime explored various technologies to enhance the efficiency of the Kamsarmax.

The new vessel concept is based on a unique combination of three tiltable rotor sails and two suction wing sails. This dual approach maximises wind power utilisation, adapting to varying wind conditions to ensure optimal performance. Henrik Sjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½blom, from Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Concepts and Advisory team notes, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This hybrid wind technology approach offers the best of both worlds, making the vessel more vs underneath and an air lubrication system to drastically reduce hydrodynamic resistance - a patent application is pending. Kongsberg Maritime has devised an innovative hull form that will trap bubbles, from an air lubrication system, to maximise the effects of resistance reduction and a patent application has been made to implement this concept. By trapping air bubbles beneath the hull, the system significantly reduces frictional resistance. The inclined hull, with a 1-degree slope from bow to stern, and vertically turned bilge keels create 'walls' to keep bubbles in place, enhancing fuel savings. Emphasising the benefits of slow steaming, the vessel operates at a reduced speed, balancing fuel efficiency with operational viability. A 1-knot speed reduction contributes to substantial savings in fuel, emissions, and maintenance costs. The vessel integrates a Hybrid Shaft Generator with frequency control, optimising electrical power usage and reducing emissions. This system supports the increased electric load from wind propulsion devices and air lubrication compressors, enhancing overall efficiency. Equipped with an Intelligent Energy Management System (iEMS) and route optimisation software, the vessel ensures optimal energy use, further enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing operational costs. To maintain the hull's cleanliness and further minimise resistance, the vessel is also fitted with a Hull Skater, which also contributes to maintaining low fuel consumption during operation. ""With a short payback period of five years, this vessel represents a smart investment for ship owners looking to reduce costs and meet future compliance targets"" Oskar Levander Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Kongsberg Maritime The 'Super-Efficient Bulker' is a novel design and advanced operation will, according to Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s analysis, reduce fuel costs by more than half compared to a state-of-the-art vessel equipped with only conventional technology. Thus, offering an attractive solution for ship owners. The concept uniquely combines two different wind assist technologies, three tiltable rotor sails and two suction wing sails, which maximises wind power by adapting to varying wind conditions for optimal performance. Oskar Levander concludes, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This project has been a real eye-opener. The combination of advanced technologies creates significant savings, making our new design a game-changer.

HUGIN Edge: A Class Leading Medium Size AUV,"HUGIN Edge: A Class Leading Medium Size AUV The latest addition to Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s HUGIN family builds on the proven capabilities of the advanced HUGIN architecture, adding cutting edge autonomy to deliver the most advanced low drag Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). 15 Mar 2022 Delivering exceptional durability and reliability, configured for ease of deployment from all platforms and offering class-leading sensor and navigation performance, HUGIN Edge is the newest member of the HUGIN family of AUVs. The new design combines elements of HUGINï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s carbon monocoque approach used with success for the last 20 years coupled to extensive hydrodynamic modelling to refine the hullï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s low-drag shape. HUGIN Edge stands out as a next-generation vehicle designed specifically to answer the performance and efficiency challenges set by the modern world. HUGIN Edge includes significant new features and capabilities. These include an innovative ved trajectory planning and directional collision avoidance coupled to traditional forward scanning methodology. To enable greater interoperability, the vehicle is equipped with the latest open interfaces for integration to 3rd party planning and mission management tools. There are also new tools specifically designed to optimise results for every deployment. Central to these are goal-based mission planning tools and mission execution. The mission planning capabilities provides a higher-level mission planning interface, requiring less specialist knowledge and input by the operator. Mission objectives may include sounding density, or detection probability enabling the AUV to calculate the actual waypoints, operational parameters and sensor configuration. In-mission adaptive execution allows HUGIN Edge to make several decisions autonomously, continuously replanning during mission execution as more information about the surrounding environment is gathered by the sensors. It is these in-mission edge-processing capabilities that drive step-changes in both performance and efficiency for all operations. Measuring less than 4 metres long, HUGIN Edge weighs approximately 300kg. It is packaged with the latest battery technology to provide more than 24 hours operation at depths of up to 1000 metres. The general arrangement includes the next generation of KONGSBERG synthetic aperture sonar, a high frequency multibeam echosounder and a swappable camera or sub-bottom profiler. This configuration has been designed to cover most geophysical survey requirements, as well as mine-countermeasures, rapid environmental assessment, search and recovery, as well as the survey of critical national infrastructure. From inception HUGIN Edge is designed to operate from Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs), small surface vessels and from shore. The design has been developed around Kongsbergï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s automated Launch and Recovery (LAR) with battery charging through inductive power providing true over the horizon operations.ï¿½cae human from the field of operations, enabling supervision from afar to minimising operational risk, maximise safety and deliver the lowest carbon footprint. Richard Mills, Vice President of Marine Robotics Sales at KM said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Since the first dive of HUGIN on 7th March 1993 it has evolved into the most successful commercial off-the-shelf autonomous underwater vehicle ever made. In that time, the shape has changed, from a smooth low-drag design to a more traditional cylindrical hull form focused on modularity and providing a flexible configuration. Over the last few years, we have released the high performance HUGIN Superior, the pinnacle of survey capabilities within autonomous vehicles and HUGIN Endurance which stretches the operational range to 2200-line kilometres in a single dive. HUGIN Edge returns to our original design philosophy of a smaller low drag body using the common architecture and user interface enabling interoperability of all HUGIN systems.

K-MATE Autonomy Controller Technology Put to Test for Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE,"K-MATE Autonomy Controller Technology Put to Test for Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE 27 Nov 2017 KONGSBERG supports GEBCO-NF Alumni Team to conduct Technology Readiness Test of unique AUV-USV concept Supported by KONGSBERG experts and technology, the GEBCO-NF Alumni Team, one of 19 semi-finalist teams competing in the $7 Million Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE competition, has completed Technology 
Readiness Tests of its unique Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) / Autonomous Underwater Vessel (AUV) concept and associated combination of communications hardware and software to process and transmit data 
remotely. The test event was held on the fjord outside KONGSBERG's factory in Horten, Norway on Thursday 23rd November. All Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE teams will hold testing site visits around the world for Round 1, which starts in November and continues until February 2018. XPRIZE officials in attendance at each 
test site will gather data on the teams' performance, which will be assessed against 11 key measurement criteria. All teams that meet these criteria will progress to the next round of field tests, with 
an announcement expected in March 2018. The assessment criteria have been designed to assess whether teams would have been capable of passing the originally planned Round 1 field tests, which were cancelled 
due to severe hurricane damage in Puerto Rico. The Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE is a global competition challenging teams to advance deep-sea technologies for autonomous, fast and high-resolution ocean exploration. The prize will stimulate even 
greater exploration and mapping of the ocean floor, helping to uncover our planet's greatest wonders and resources for the benefit of humanity. The GEBCO-NF Alumni Team's concept utilises a SEA-KIT unmanned surface vessel, USV Maxlimer. The SEA-KIT vessel has been built by Hushcraft in the UK. USV Maxlimer performed faultlessly during the 
Technology Readiness Tests event, where the team demonstrated the USV's unique ability to launch and recover a KONGSBERG HUGIN AUV, and track it accurately on the surface during subsea survey operations. The autonomous navigation and AUV tracking capabilities of the USV are possible through the integration of the KONGSBERG & Hushcraft custom developed automation and software configuration in conjunction 
with KONGSBERG's K-MATE common autonomous control engine. K-MATE will also be used by several unmanned and autonomous vessels delivered by Kongsberg Maritime, including the fully electric container feeder; 
YARA Birkeland. The autonomy controller has been developed in a collaboration between Kongsberg Maritime and FFI, the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, and builds on the HUGIN AUV System. The GEBCO-NF Alumni Team is led by alumni of The Nippon Foundation / General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Postgraduate Certificate in Ocean Bathymetry Training Programme, now in its fourteenth

"Hydroid and Kongsberg GeoAcoustic's Collaborative Work Provides the World with First, AUV-Captured High-Definition Sonar Images of Two WW II Wrecks","Hydroid and Kongsberg GeoAcoustic's Collaborative Work Provides the World with First, AUV-Captured High-Definition Sonar Images of Two WW II Wrecks 26 Jun 2014 A successful partnership between Hydroid Inc. (a KONGSBERG company) and Kongsberg GeoAcoustics has produced the first high-definition images of two WWII U.S. Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs) that lie off the coast of South Devon, UK. The vessels were sunk on April 28, 1944 by German torpedo boats that interrupted the Exercise Tiger training mission, which took place in southern England. The training was the secret rehearsal for 
the Utah Beach portion of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France. Well kept secret Royal Navy MASTT member with Remus 100. The tragedy left nearly 1,000 U.S. servicemen dead, making it one of the deadliest training-related events of the war. The carnage was far greater than the actual invasion on Utah Beach, yet full details 
about the attack weren't made public immediately. To keep the Allies' invasion plans secret, those who survived the attack were ordered not to say a word. The death toll wasn't announced until nearly 
two months after D-Day, according to The Associated Press. Full details were not disclosed until 1974, when records of the torpedo strike were declassified. The historical account of the D-Day invasion 
in France has overshadowed the UK training tragedy for decades. As a result, it's one of the best-kept secrets of World War II. 70th anniversary With April 28th, 2014 marking the 70th anniversary of this event, Graham Lester, Hydroid's Vice President of Sales & Marketing, wanted to help pay tribute to the lives lost during the Exercise Tiger 
tragedy. After visiting the beachside memorial in Torcross, UK last summer, Lester started planning the Hydroid Exercise Tiger AUV Mission to commemorate the event. The idea was to use an AUV to capture 
high-resolution images of the wreckage and help shed additional light on this historic tragedy. Graham wanted to help complete the story of what happened for the servicemen and families involved, and 
provide future generations with a better account of the events that took place in the area. ""These images are adding to the historic photo album that honours the lives lost during the Exercise Tiger tragedy 
in 1944,"" said Lester. LST-531 side by side comparison. Between March 10th and 21st, 2014, two AUV operating teams, one from Hydroid Europe and the other from the Royal Navy's Maritime Autonomous System Trials Team (MASTT), undertook missions to collect 
data from the area. Hydroid's team focused on the last known location of the two torpedoed LSTs - 531 and 507 - approximately 40 miles off the coast, in the English Channel. MASTT focused on the area 
just off Slapton Sands, where they located an object of interest. They are still analyzing the data to understand if the object is related to the 1944 tragedy. Using the REMUS 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with both Edgetech side-scan sonar and Kongsberg GeoAcoustics' GeoSwath multibeam sonar, the Hydroid team produced the first high-definition 
sonar images ever collected of the two wrecks. This was the first time in history that an AUV had surveyed the area. Side scan sonar image of the LST-507 taken from the REMUS100.

""It is rewarding to know our engineers 
offered their time to such an important project. The high-resolution sonar investigation of this 150-footdeep site reveals many previously unseen details. The images, showing the ships broken in two, 
also bring home the scale and tragedy of what happened that night, seventy years ago. The images help tell a story that, until now, has remained largely untold.""

Collaboration In the true spirit of one of the company's core values, collaboration, employees from Hydroid Inc., Kongsberg GeoAcoustics and Kongsberg Maritime, Aberdeen all worked together to bring these images 
to the public. Hydroid was represented by Graham Lester, Vice President, Sales & Marketing, Richard ""Bungy"" Williams, Regional Manager of Hydroid Europe and Hydroid Europe Field Technicians, Mostefa Khalfallah, 
and Iain Roalf. Kongsberg GeoAcoustics provided expertise from Peter Hogarth, President, Ralf Timm, Vice President, Sales and James Baxter, Applications Manager. James was the individual who actually 
processed the data and put countless hours into creating the data video, which is now, in the public domain. Craig Wallace, Subsea Applications Engineer, Kongsberg Maritime, Aberdeen was also instrumental 
in the use of the heave/depth compensation methodology software he developed. Media coverage The Hydroid Exercise Tiger AUV Mission has received a tremendous amount of international media coverage. A recent NBC.com article included the following: Laurie Bolton, honorary director of the Tank Memorial site, was born eight years after her uncle, Sgt. Louis A. Bolton, perished during Exercise Tiger, she said. His body was never recovered. ""In recent years we had divers down at the wrecks and sonar, but nothing like this,"" Bolton told NBC News after seeing the sonar images. Bolton said the images help clear up some of the mystery surrounding the state of the sunken ships and ""complete the story.""

Kongsberg Maritime forms joint venture with Lodic,"Kongsberg Maritime forms joint venture with Lodic 23 Sep 2008 Kongsberg Maritime recently became the majority owners of Lodic AS resulting 
in the establishment of a joint venture between the two companies. The acquisition 
was finalised in August this year, and will result in a more complete product range 
from Kongsberg Maritime with special emphasis on its new 'Green Ship' strategy. About Lodic Lodic AS originates from MARINTEK (Norwegian Marine Technology Research Institute), 
and was formed as a commercial spin-off of the high-tech cluster created by the 
SINTEF Group and NTNU (University of Technology and Science) in Trondheim, Norway. 
The company's software has roots in the 1970s when MARINTEK started making software 
for hydrostatics and stability calculations for ships and floating offshore structures. Optimal trimming and cruising speed One of Lodic's core products is the ShipLoad 3-D vessel model tool, a unique 
solution for managing loading and unloading operations. The system undertakes calculations 
to ensure optimal loading and unloading of cargoes as well as ballasting. Combined 
with Kongsberg Maritime's K-Bridge weather planning and an intelligent auto pilot 
the system advises mariners on optimal trimming and cruising speed. Reduced fuel consumption The ShipLoad 3-D vessel model tool utilises a 3-D model of the vessel's hydrostatics 
as a basis for the calculation of loading conditions, floating position as well 
as stability and longitudinal strength. By utilising the full geometrical definition 
as a basis for the computation, several additional applications have been developed 
to improve the load planning, condition handling and hull performance. These are 
all applications that enable optimal usage of the vessel and thereby reduce the 
relative fuel consumption. The Kongsberg ShipLoad loading computer is available 
for several vessel applications, such as tankers and FPSOs, container vessels, ferries 
and RoRo vessels, cruise vessels and supply vessels. General Manager of Offshore and Merchant Marine in Kongsberg Maritime, Ketil 
Paulsen, says the new ShipLoad 3-D loading computer reinforces KONGSBERG's already 
existing product range. ""A joint venture with Lodic AS will strengthen Kongsberg Maritime in an area 
that we hadn't completely explored. It means that we can offer customers a more 
complete product range and additional expertise in automatic loading and unloading. 
We have previously delivered several types of ship loading calculators, but the 
ShipLoad loading calculator will ensure a standardisation and improvement of the 
product. The acquisition further strengthens our 'Green Ship' strategy with special 
emphasis on optimal operations and less emissions,"" said Paulsen.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/kongsberg-maritime-forms-joint-venture-with-lodic/

Diesel Generator System Simulator and a state of the art Maritime Technician Lead in Simulator. Photo copyright: Commonwealth of Australia. The customised simulator model is a high-fidelity representation of the engine room configuration on the LSD(A) (Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary)) vessel, HMAS Choules. The full scope of supply consists 
of the new model with a Big View interactive mimic showing 3D virtual systems and fully interactive switchboard mimics for the engine control room. The LSD(A) delivery is part of the CoA implementation plan to increase the use of simulators in training. The simulator model has been procured within the Ship Specific Component (NMP 1935) of the 
Marine Technician Lead in Simulator (MT LIS) and is complementary to the generic simulator capability in HMAS Cerberus (NMP 1930). The model reuses existing K-Sim Engine simulator infrastructure such 
as base simulator software, in addition to the hardware and the competence already gained by HMAS Cerberus instructors. Since the Force Structure Review 2008, the Australian Defence Force's strategic guidance has increasingly focused on the use of simulation to increase force generation capacity in a cost effective 
manner. One of Navy's responses to this guidance has been to increase progressively the efficiency and effectiveness of its training and qualification system using simulation-based training ashore to 
increase the effectiveness of the training and the operational availability of platforms; and reduce the risks that the training poses to the safety of personnel and the integrity of equipment. ""Kongsberg Maritime was chosen following the CoA's positive experience of the customised K-Sim Engine full mission simulator delivered in Sydney for the training of engineers aboard the RAN's Canberra 
Class Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) vessels and the desktop K-Sim Engine simulator delivered at HMAS Cerberus,"" said Tone-Merete Hansen, Global Sales Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ""With KONGSBERG's support, 
the LHD Engineering System Trainer (LEST) has significantly improved training for LHD vessel engineering personnel. The new K-Sim Engine LSD(A) model will extend the RAN's training capabilities, offering 
the same operational benefits through high quality simulation training.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/new-customised-kongsberg-engine-room-simulator-model-for-royal-australian-navy/
KONGSBERG propeller blade air emissions technology enables a silent sea,"KONGSBERG propeller blade air emissions technology enables a silent sea Kongsberg Maritime has successfully adapted a propeller concept used in naval applications and is now offering the same operational and environmental benefits to commercial shipping customers. 05 Jul 2019 While the naval sector has been using KONGSBERG Blade Air Emission technology for a number of years, with several navies deploying it to limit vessel signature, the process is now being applied to commercial ship propellers to reduce the effect of underwater radiated noise on marine life. By machining a channel into the leading edge of the propeller blades, the Blade Air Emissions concept significantly reduces cavitation-induced noise and erosion risk. The Blade Air Emission concept, applicable to conventional fixed pitched and controllable pitched propellers, applies the results of extensive research undertaken at the KONGSBERG Hydrodynamic Research Centre (KHRC) in Kristinehamn, Sweden, to offer a more silent propeller to the commercial marine market. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Propellers optimised with the Blade Air Emission system have for some time been used on naval vessels to reduce and distort vessel signature. Following the success of the system we can now roll out the concept to the wider shipping industry as a way to reduce propeller noise and erosion risk.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Robert Gustafsson Senior Hydrodynamicist, KHRC Propellers accept cavitation to optimise vessel performance and efficiency, but by carefully balancing the amount of air circulated around the blades, Kongsberg Maritime can optimise the negative effects of cavitation without adversely affecting ship efficiency. According to Gustafsson there is an equilibrium. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½With too much air, the underwater radiated noise increases, and propeller efficiency reduces. There is a sweet spot. We can optimise the propeller using this concept to achieve the optimum noise reduction without affecting propulsion performance.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Blade Air Emission technology. While there are financial advantages in reducing the cost of repairing or replacing propeller blades damaged by cavitation erosion, the concept minimises substantially the underwater radiated noise from a shipï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s propeller, which in some cases can be 180dB. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This is a major environmental problem and is already being considered at a regulatory level. It affects the migratory, reproduction and feeding patterns of marine life, such as dolphins, whales and other species. It also causes high levels of stress for marine life.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are offering the industry a more silent propeller for the benefit of the environment and the ship operator. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a real game-change in propeller design,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Grunditz .

Two minutes with the man in chargeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Kongsberg Maritime caught up with Captain Will Whatley, Master of the Royal Research Ship, Sir David Attenborough, working for the British Antarctic Survey. KM : Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s an exciting day today with great anticipation. What does a day like this mean to you? WW : This is a huge moment in my career. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s been a long time that Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been involved in this project, since July 2016, so itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s been a huge amount of effort to get to this major and final milestone in the construction of this fantastic ship. KM : So, whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s next in terms of sea trials? Whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s left to do in the yard before sea trials commence? WW : At the moment, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re in the final stages of internal outfit, and weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re commissioning the systems. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve stiand weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll then commence our scientific sea trials, which will include things like icebreaking, and testing with helicoptersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it will be very involved. KM : So, a chance to put her through her paces in the real environment she has been designed for. WW : Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s right, yes. KM : In terms of the design ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ obviously, formerly a Rolls-Royce design and now a KONGSBERG design ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ what are you looking forward to about the structure and the design of the hull form in particular, as an experienced captain? What do you think this will bring you? WW : Well, Rolls-Royce, now Kongsberg, were given a big challenge to try and fit lots of features into one hull, and as such theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve had to make lots of compromises. But I think, considering that the specification they were given, to try and fit all of these capabilities into one hull, theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve done real your career, and how you think a ship like this could handle them? WW : The worst conditions are either big sea states or heavy ice. We do experience a lot of Southern Ocean storms with massive seas, and thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s no shelter, but the ship is designed to withstand that, and thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s no reason why she wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t do so.

KONGSBERG supports NATO submarine rescue system acceptance trials,"KONGSBERG supports NATO submarine rescue system acceptance trials Camera, sonar and transponder technology from Kongsberg Maritime vital to the success of future submarine rescues. 23 Oct 2008 Engineers from Kongsberg Maritime have been in the thick of the action in France and Norway during a combined trial and military exercise period involving the NATO Submarine Rescue Systemï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½- NSRS. The NSRS is an extensive project by the French, Norwegian and UK Navies, to provide a fast response, highly mobile, distressed submarine (DISSUB) rescue platform. Kongsberg equipment Kongsberg Maritime has played a significant role in the development of the NSRS, having supplied navigation, underwater positioning and communications for the sophisticated new Submarine Rescue Vessel (SRV) and ROV, in addition to developing a Portable Navigation and Command Tracking System - PNTCS designed to permit the Commander of Rescue Forces - CRF to locate, and position a DISSUB. Commercial components The PNTCS is based on cents configured and packaged for naval operations in very harsh environments. It integrates inputs from numerous navigation sensors to provide a world image of the location of the DISSUB and its orientation, the SRV and any cooperating ROVs, with underwater positioning provided by the HPR 400 system and MST Transponders. The PNTCS is housed in one easily deployable 8 foot by 10 foot ISO container of which the NSRS will use two, to ensure that multiple vessels can share the same data during rescue operations. Trials The combined trials and exercise period, which saw NSRS operating at sea for 3 weeks, was supported by Keith Needham and Mike Duffin of Kongsberg Maritime Ltd in Portsmouth, who have both been instrumental in installing the Kongsberg Maritime equipment for the project. During trials, the Submarine Rescue Vessel dived and mated with a target in 600m of water (the deepest ever mate by any rescue vessel) in Hardanger Fjord, Norway and took part in its first NATO exercise, called Bold Monarch. About Bold Monarch Bold Monarch took place off the picturesque, coastal town of Arendal in the south east of Norway. Kongsberg Maritime's role was to install and operate the Portable PNTCS during the exercise. The exercise involved mating the SRV with submarines from Norway, Poland and Holland with transfer of personnel to and from the surface. PNTCSs were deployed on the French 'Argonaut' and on the Norwegian 'Harstad' support vessels. The operations were observed by representatives from Russia, Turkey, Canada and several other submarine operating nations. Experience Kongsberg Maritime equipment was involved in a real DISSUB drama in 2005. A Royal Navy Submarine Service ROV used Kongsberg Maritime underwater cameras to navigate and cut the fishing cables that the Russian Priz AS-28 submarine had become entangled in. All six crew members survived, with just hours of air to spare, demonstrating the future need for a fast, highly mobile submarine rescue service like the NSRS.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/kongsberg-supports-nato-submarine-rescue-system-acceptance-trials/

DNV Recognition of Training,"DNV Recognition of Training 12 May 2009 As the first to arrive at DNV approval for a complete nautical and engine training 
programme, Kongsberg Maritime's training department shows its dedication to qualitative 
course delivery. Since June 2008, Kongsberg Maritime and DNV Seaskillsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ have been working together 
to develop course approvals on Kongsberg Maritime's K-Chief 700 and K-Bridge product 
courses. In January this year, the course certificate was finally complete. Project 
Manager in Kongsberg Maritime, Hallfrid Os-Andersen is confident that the approvals 
will be an advantage for future course participants adding an extra mark of quality 
""When we started this process, the two companies had very different views, something 
which forced us to look through our own course material and structure"", she says. 
""Previous evaluation and more than 20 years experience within this business tells 
us that we are already delivering high quality training. Building on this experience 
in cooperation with DNV is a sign of seriousness from our side resulting in a more 
flexible training offer"". DNV SeaSkillï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is a department within Det Norske Veritas assisting shipping companies, 
manufacturers and training providers to assure that competence is properly addressed, 
built and retained. In other words; they do not perform the training themselves, 
but put their highly esteemed stamp of approval on maritime training providers' 
courses. Despite their long history of approving courses, this particular task was 
n""This has been an educational process for both companies and a new way of looking 
at course presentations from our side"", says Project Manager in DNV Seaskills, Thomas 
Jacobsen. ""We have worked hard to find ways to fit the KM courses into our DNV standard, 
something which has been very useful for further development of our way of verifying 
courses"". Accreditation increasingly important Although Kongsberg Maritime will be the first maritime training provider to offer 
DNV approved product courses, they will probably not be the last. According to Jacobsen, 
course accreditation is gaining importance and there is an increasing demand for 
competence based training from employers. ""In our experience, most accidents at 
sea are caused by human errors. In order to avoid this, we need to ensure that the 
crew can operate the relevant equipment properly. This is achieved through appropriate 
training and the ability to prove your skills through certified courses"", he comments. One way of ensuring that participants have gained the relevant knowledge, is by 
conducting a final assessment at the end of the course. Consequently, this is a 
central part of the DNV standard for accrediting courses. ""Ship owners must find 
out what their employees need in order to operate the systems and make specific 
demands to the training suppliers. The final assessment will confirm that they are 
fit to operate a specific system"", says Jacobsen. The final assessment is only one of the criteria that need to be fulfilled. Strict 
rules apply in order to obtain the DNV accreditation, such as regulations regarding 
training environment and class size. All course material also has to be standardised 
and revised by DNV. In addition their standard includes certain quality requirements 
for the course instructors, resulting in an increasing focus on teaching skills 
in Kongsberg Maritime's training department. ""An important part of this process 
has been taking teaching skills more seriously in our organisation"", says Business 
Manager, training in Kongsberg Maritime, Anne Toril Kasin. ""All course instructors 
must now attend a teaching course in order to learn how to convey their knowledge 
in an understandable manner"". A la carte training A key to the DNV approval is a module based course structure. Consequently, course 
participants can take part in training that is tailor made for their needs. ""We 
have a lot of different training modules in Kongsberg Maritime,"" says Hallfrid Os-Andersen. 
""Many clients want 20-25% of the same core modules and the rest of the course is 
adapted to their specific need. Consequently, we can now offer a pool of modules 
that the instructor can choose from to put together a complete training package, 
while participants previously had to follow a certain programme for a full week."" Training manager Kasin, agrees that tailor made courses are the future and wishes 
to provide ""The Full Picture"" also within training. ""Tailor made courses are right 
in the core of Kongsberg Maritime's spirit,"" she says. ""We always have a wish to 
adjust to the client's needs, and this is no different for the training department."" Future accreditations Initially a response to a customer request for one specific product area, the 
plan is to extend course accreditation to Kongsberg Maritime's entire training offer. 
The next courses in line for approval are K-Pos dynamic positioning system) and 
K-Chief 500 monitoring and control system. ""Accrediting courses is not something 
we had to do, but something we chose to do. Having an experienced external party 
correcting us is important and gives us a reassurance that what we are doing is 
actually good. DNV Seaskillï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ has a good standard for accreditation and our cooperation 
with t"", says Kasin. With extensive and versatile experience within course accreditation and a good 
combination of highly qualified staff consisting of both teachers and maritime professionals, 
DNV Seaskillï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is well equippe""We look forward to continue 
our good cooperation with Kongsberg Maritime, and we are very proud to have an international

KONGSBERG eBird seismic streamer control system nominated for prestigious design award,"KONGSBERG eBird seismic streamer control system nominated for prestigious design award 24 Feb 2011 Unique 'diving bird' technology highlighted for design innovation. eBirdï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is equipped with robust and advanced steering devices ensuring continuous operation for all types of streaming cables. Gives the surveyor positive control of streamer roll orientation, depth and separation. Kongsberg Seatex's unique 'eBird' Seismic Streamer Control System has been nominated for the prestigious Honours Award for Design Excellence by the Norwegian Design Council (NDC). Kongsberg Seatex, 
Kongsberg Maritime's specialist in position reference systems, and attitude determination, is one of four companies to be nominated, with the winner to be announced during the Norwegian Design Day on 
Wednesday 16th March, 2011. With oil & gas exploration taking place in increasingly demanding environments, the offshore industry depends on new technology to overcome the challenges caused by working further from shore and in Kongsberg Seatex's eBird is one such piece of technology. It is a novel bird concept for lateral, vertical and roll streamer control in marine seismic acquisition that enables fault tolerant 
and efficient multi streamer steering by employing a wide range of innovative and patented technological solutions. According to R&D Manager at Kongsberg Seatex, Arne Rinnan, the starting point for eBird was an idea from Kongsberg Seatex almost 20 years old: ""Some ideas take longer to mature than others. Even though 
the idea has existed for a long time, it was not until we had a competitive concept that we took the first steps towards the product development of eBird."" In short-listing eBird for the design award, the NDC panel of judges recognises the overall design and operational value of this unique system. A number of details also highlight eBird as an innovative 
design, including the titanium body for maximum tensile strength as well as extraordinary corrosion resistance. The smart design and construction ensures very low acoustic noise, and can be adapted to 
all types of streamer cables, whilst the innovative implementation utilising connector-less power and signal transfer between body and wings makes eBirdï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ robust for all operatio""We developed the eBirdï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ technology in close cooperation with the industry, which has also facilitated extensive tests and trials. A team of designers from Inventas in Trondheim got involved during 
the early development of eBird and has been a fully integrated part of the development group through"" continues Rinnan. ""We live by developing products with qualities that make them leaders 
within their markets. To be nominated for this honours award proves that we have succeeded in implementing good design to enable the benefits that eBird offers to the industry."" eBird was launched at the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) annual meeting in Houston in October 2009 and was quickly recognised as one of the most innovative seismic products to be introduced 
for a long time. A cooperation agreement with PGS, a major maritime seismic operator strengthened this position, implying that that eBird will be standardised as a steering unit on a range of the company's 
advanced cables.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/kongsberg-ebird-seismic-streamer-control-system-nominated-for-prestigious-design/

recent technological advances in sonar technologies and how these can protect military 
and civilian ports and visiting ships from attack by enemy divers. The white paper 
is entitled ""New Advances in Sonar Diver Detection Systems: The Hidden Threat Facing 
Military and Civilian Ports."" This new Kongsberg white paper outlines the hidden threat presented by underwater 
diver incursion, as evidenced by groups such as the Tamil ""Sea"" Tigers having been 
able to mount successful underwater attacks in ports. It also reviews the latest 
technological improvements in underwater acoustical diver detection systems in these 
key areas: hardware, tracking software and data fusion/systems integration. ""The increased use of divers by groups such as the Tamil Tigers to attack from 
the water demonstrates a belief that underwater access presents an easier way to 
enter ports and attack ships anchored at dockside,"" said Phil Andrew, manager of 
underwater security for Kongsberg Mesotech, a leading global provider of sonar technologies 
that has provided sonar to the U.S. Coast Guard through its Underwater Port Security 
Project. ""Drug smuggling and the rise of terrorist threats over the last ten years have 
increased the need to monitor the underwater lanes of our ports using sonar and 
other technologies. Fortunately, recent sophisticated innovations are helping to 
address this problem. This white paper explains how these advances can help improve 
port security."" About Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd. Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd. is a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime and a world leader

KONGSBERG expands RADius range with RADius multiple sensor head solutions,"KONGSBERG expands RADius range with RADius multiple sensor head solutions 12 Jun 2007 Kongsberg Seatex has further developed its proven RADius relative positioning 
		system for offshore applications. Kongsberg Seatex, the position reference division of Kongsberg Maritime, has 
further developed its proven RADius relative positioning system for offshore applications. 
The new RADius solution can have up to four active sensor heads (interrogators) 
that collaborate to gain increased coverage and redundancy. The new system has been 
developed as a result of customer and market feedback. The RADius system measures distance and bearing between a moving vessel equipped 
with RADius sensor heads and retro-reflective transponders mounted on the target 
that the vessel is approaching. Multiple RADius sensor heads onboard increase the 
angle at which the transponder signal can be received, which allows further flexibility 
to navigate on approach to the transponder equipped target. This in turn provides 
more freedom and safer manoeuvring. The RADius 1000 D - dual system There are two new RADius systems available. The 1000 D (dual) system is a multiple 
sector system and provides two sensor heads that can be mounted on suitable places 
on the vessel dependent on the construction of the vessel or operation the vessel 
should do. For instance, mounting them both on the front of the vessel increases 
the reception angle and thereby transponder signal availability for applications 
where the vessel moves into position bow first. The interrogators can also be mounted 
on either side of a vessel, which will increase flexibility of operations as the 
vessel can approach using RADius on port or starboard. RADius 1000 Q - quad system The RADius 1000 Q - quad system is an omni directional system and utilises four 
sensor heads, which can be placed on suitable locations on the vessel dependent 
on the construction and operation. This can provide full 360ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ signal acquisition 
as well as avoidance of blind angles as tensor head at a receiving 
angle to transponders at all times, regardless of the vessels relative position 
to the RADius transponder equipped target. The increased flexibility of the RADius 
Quad system provides benefits in safety - increased RADius positioning availability, 
and flexibility as the vessel can approach its target either side, bow or stern 
on. ""RADius has already proven itself as an invaluable relative positioning tool 
for DP operations in the offshore sector,"" comments Arne Rinnan, Technical Director, 
Kongsberg Seatex. ""We continue to develop the system to ensure we are maximising 
the performance of this technology, and the new versions of the system together 
with the new RADius transponders, are direct results of this strategy."" RADius uses low power FM CW signals to ensure an accurate position reading without 
any moving parts, thus the system has low maintenance costs and is easy to deploy. 
This makes it ideal as a complementary system for use in harsh and demanding offshore 
environments where GPS due to i.e. shading, may have reduced availability.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/kongsberg-expands-radius-range-with-radius-multiple-sensor-head-solutions/

product seminar in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China 11th to 13th March 2009. The 
attendees came from all over China to learn about the capabilities of the GeoSwath 
wide swath bathymetry and side-scan sonar from GeoAcoustics Ltd of Great Yarmouth, 
UK - A Kongsberg Maritime company. Live demonstrations were followed by lectures 
on the sonar theory and best survey practice and expert tips were given on processing 
survey data using the GeoSwath Plus software. The Qingdao seminar was organised by Mike Zang of China-ORES Ltd, GeoAcoustics' 
agent in China, and lectures were given by Dr. Tom Hiller, Product Manager at GeoAcoustics 
Ltd. China-ORES Ltd of Qingdao is headed by Professor Tang Bao Jue. Professor Tang 
was awarded GeoAcoustics' top agent prize in both 2007 and 2008. The seminar included data collection using a local boat in Jaiazhou Bay. The 
survey area varied between 3m and 25m depth and demonstrated the GeoSwath's wide 
swath capability in shallow water environments. Clients could also see the advantages 
of the simultaneous bathymetry and side scan data collected by the GeoSwath. A day 
in the classroom covering the GeoSwath interferometric sonar theory was followed 
by live processing and calibration of the collected data and a master class on survey 
practice. Mike did a great job doing a live translation of the lectures for the 
local audience. GeoSwath in China More than 25 GeoSwath systems are now operational in China. These are working 
on projects such as river navigation, coastal mapping, dredge works, port surveys, 
marine construction and dam monitoring. An example of the GeoSwath's success in 
China is its use in national hydrographic mapping projects: recently the State Ocean 
Administration (SOA) East Sea Branch in Shanghai celebrated passing 75,000 line-km 
of GeoSwath survey for China's National Project 908, a major national coastal and 
environmental mapping initiative. SOA East Sea Branch now operates two GeoSwath

It offers high accuracy but is smaller, more compact and easier to install on a vessel or other surface unit than larger acoustic positioning systems. The size, weight and ease of installation makes ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PAP 
ae of applications including, Aquaculture, Seabed Survey, Seabed Cleaning, Marine Research, Diving Operations, Underwater Construction, ROV Operations, 
Shallow Water Seismic, Shallow Water Inspection, Ocean Renewable Energy and Salt to Fresh Water Production. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PAP introduces a series of advanced new transducers that feature more elements than any of its competitors in the portable and low cost market. It's established that more elements provide better acoustic 
redundancy, mathematical redundancy and improvement of the Signal to Noise level, so ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PAP's sophisticated transducers can provide more accurate and reliable position data down to 4000 m range. A built 
in motion sensor in the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PAP transducer compensates for vessel roll and pitch movements. To meet various demands from the market, the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PAP transducer is available in several versions featuring different 
built-in motion sensors and physical size. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PAP benefits from the Cand data communication, though other acoustic protocols can be utilised. The system can also

New Biofouling Trials Established to Reduce Fish Farm Sensors Maintenance Requirements,"New Biofouling Trials Established to Reduce Fish Farm Sensors Maintenance Requirements 03 Nov 2016 Live trials of a new solution to combat biofouling on essential underwater fish farm sensors taking place in Norway Extending time between sensor head cleaning from one month to 18 months KONGSBERG and AML Oceanographic, Canada, have teamed-up to conduct live trials of a new solution to combat biofouling on essential underwater 
fish farm sensors. AML is an innovative manufacturer of Sound Velocity, CTD and environmental sensors, probes and instruments with anti-fouling capabilities. The trial is focused on a new solution for 
extending the period between the cleaning of subsea oxygen sensors, which are mandated by law but also critical to the health of the fish being farmed. The trial, taking place in Norway, is based on deployment of KONGSBERG's CONTROS HydroFlash O2 subsea oxygen sensor. The sensors have been installed with the AML Oceanographic Biofouling Control system, 
which can enable them to remain in place without cleaning for up to 18 months. Currently, subsea fish farm sensors require cleaning approximately once a month, to ensure continuous operation. AML's biofouling 
technology is a more economic and environmentally friendly alternative to the present practice of injecting poison into the environment to protect the instrumentation. Biofouling is a common and costly problem for fish farms. Fouling prevents accurate readings from sensors, necessitating frequent maintenance. The AML Oceanographic Biofouling Control system integrated 
on KONGSBERG's sensors for the trial uses UV light to prevent the formation of biofilms on surfaces. If the biofilm is prevented, biofouling will not occur on the surface. The premise has been known since 
the 1950's however practical implementations have not been possible until now. AML Oceanographic's UV biofouling systems combine low power, flexible irradiation areas and compact size into a device well 
suited to protecting oceanographic instrumentation. The weather plays an important role in fish farm sensor maintenance, with harsh winters making it more difficult to ensure cleaning can be carried out regularly. This problem is further compounded 
for the new ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½exposed' Ocean Farming As/Salmar fish farm development taking place offshore Frohavet in Norway. Due to the exposed nature of this, the world's first offshore fish farm, sensor maintenance 
will become more difficult so a solution that enables longer sensor deployment without the need for monthly cleaning is an important cost and efficiency factor. KONGSBERG is a key technology stakeholder 
in the Salmar exposed fish farm development, having been contracted to deliver subsea, surface and vessel systems CONTROS HydroFlash O2 subsea oxygen sensors are a versatile subsea, shallow and deep-water oxygen sensor used for autonomous deployments as well as integrated into sensor systems, including KONGSBERG's 
K-Observer autonomous monitoring, analysis and reporting system. The advanced, optical sensorle of fluorescence quenching. Due to the chemical interactions required to make the 
sensor work, keeping the sensor surface clear of biofouling is essential. ""If it is possible to use Oxygen sensors for one full breeding cycle, and only clean them during the service period between, the fish farming industry will see benefits in both reduced operational 
costs and increased safety,"" said Sï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ren Themann, VP Subsea Monitoring, Kong""The unique combination of the CONTROS HydroFlash O2 subsea oxygen sensors and AML's anti-fouling capabilities 
has already proven to be a very good fit. The trial so far has delivered promising results. The system is deployed at a real fish farm in Norway and will stay there for a full year. After the first three 
months no biofouling has been found in the sensor area.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/new-biofouling-trials-established-to-reduce-fish-farm-sensors-maintenance/

Innovative new radar solution unveiled at Nor-Shipping 2013,"Innovative new radar solution unveiled at Nor-Shipping 2013 04 Jun 2013 Kongsberg Maritime is presenting a new solution for the distribution of Radar data on board ships during Nor-Shipping 2013 (Stand C03-24). Utilisation of an Ethernet based LAN (Local Area Network) 
is a significant addition to Kongsberg Maritime's K-Bridge Integrated Bridge System and is capable of improving safety and navigation through enhanced Radar functionality whilst offering significant installation 
benefits. The system is currently undergoing Type Approval testing at DNV, with first customer delivery in Autumn 2013. The LAN topology is based on a newly developed Radar Interface Network (RIN) unit to be located at each antenna, connected to the Multi Functional Display (MFD) units on the K-Bridge by a Local Area 
Network (LAN). Former Radar network topology uses analogue cables and an interswitch, which limits network design, the number of displays data can be sent to and how the data may be handled and presented. Kongsberg Maritime's LAN network architecture uses contemporary networking methodology. Radar data can be shared by an unlimited number of Multi Functional Displays (MFD's) without a dedicated Radar 
interswitch. The MFD can be configured as a standard Radar display, or it may be configured with additional views combining information from several integrated subsystems. An example of this is the possibility 
of views mixing the Radar image with data from a dynamic positioning system. The new Radar topology provides significant enhancements in how Radar data is presented, made possible because of the digital network, improved signal processing and automatic Radar and picture tuning. 
Images from several Radar antennas can be viewed on the same screen including the possibility to view both X-band and S-band data in the same image. By presenting a picture compiled in real-time from 
several Radar antennas, the operator is given a high quality, detailed picture that displays seamless tracking of up to 1000 targets in a full 360 degree view. Because the Radar LAN is based on standard Ethernet data cables instead of the analogue cables traditionally used for Radar, much longer distances between the display and antenna can be achieved, which 
enables more flexible network design with considerably lower installation and maintenance costs. ""The new Radar topology introduces digital networking to Radar, so it is a significant step-forward in navigation and safety technology,"" comments Gudbrand Strï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mmen, Navigation Development Department 
Manager, Kong""The possibilities this introduces can transform how Radar is used on board. At the same time, we are able to offer such a wide range of new functionality, that will improve 
navigation safety and efficiency whilst reducing installation costs and providing a highly redundant and easy to maintain Radar system.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2013/innovative-new-radar-solution-unveiled-at-nor-shipping-2013/

Live 3D data streaming ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ new Simrad visualisa,"Live 3D data streaming ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ new Simrad visualisation SW unveiled in Vigo Kongsberg Maritime has unveiled an advanced new technology platform at the ICES Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics, Science and Technology (WGFAST) in Vigo today (19th April), which enables live 
streaming of 3D data generated by scientific multibeam systems. The unique, new Simrad TD50 data visualisation software is currently operational with the Simrad ME70 scientific multibeam echo sounder, 
with plans to enable 3D data streaming from a wider range of Simrad acoustic systems in the future. 19 Apr 2016 Accurate 3D visualisation gives users a better understanding of the marine ecosystem by i.e. enabling precise measurement of schools of fish rather than estimating size and shapes based on models. The Simrad TD50 software reads the incredibly clean raw data from the ME70 in real time and delivers accurate live visualisation of the oceanspace beneath the vessel to the scientific lab on board 
and to the bridge. Pr be post-processed before the 3D potential of the system was realised, but with a live feed now available, researchers and vessel crews benefit from a new 
highly effective decision support tool that can enhance vessel efficiency and the effectiveness of scientific surveys in general. Accurate 3D visualisation gives users a better understanding of the marine ecosystem by i.e. enabling precise measurement of schools of fish rather than estimating size and shapes based on models. 
Additionally, 3D view of bottom topography and the relating bottom habitats further enhances the understanding of the marine ecosystems. When accurate 3D visualisation is delivered in real-time, the 
benefits are significant. The Simrad TD50 system is especially relevant to projects using adaptive sampling, as the live 3D stream of the survey area enables researchers to see specific attributes as 
the vessel passes over them, allowing action for further inspection to be taken immediately. The live 3D stream from the Simrad ME70 data can be delivered to multiple locations on board which allows for better interaction between scientists and the vessel operators, typically important in 
demanding operations where the vessel interacts with objects in the water column. Research vessels engaged in active sampling of biology such as trawling can also improve their capabilities, with the 
Simrad TD50 system effectively providing a 'long range camera' below the surface. The ME70 is a calibrated system with extremely low noise data, making it possible to map very small targets, such as plankton layers, at the same time as strong targets, such as fish school or 
bottom. The ME70 has been adopted by several key research organisations worldwide including France's Ifremer on board 'L'Europe' and 'Thalassa', and Norway's Institute of Marine Research (IMR) on 
board the new 'Kronprins Haakon' Research Vessel. The latter is equipped with an extensive suite of KONGSBERG systems for research vessels, including the full range of scientific equipment for marine 
ecosystem assessment. ""The Simrad TD50 has been a fantastic story,"" said Tonny Algrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½y, Global Sales Manager, Simrad Fishery Research, Kong""Real time 3D visualisation of massive data like this was said to 
be impossible only years ago, but with help from Kongsberg Digital's 3D center of excellence we have now upped the ME70 capabilities to a new level. Research vessels can now react immediately to 
changes in the environment they study, which is a facility that has the potential to create a positive step-change in the way scientific surveys are conducted.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/live-3d-data-streaming--new-simrad-visualisation-sw-unveiled-in-vigo/

New calibrated backscatter data enhances KONGSBERG GeoSwath Plus multibeam seafloor identification,"New calibrated backscatter data enhances KONGSBERG GeoSwath Plus multibeam seafloor identification The latest release of Kongsberg Maritime's advanced GeoTexture software for the GeoSwath Plus line of multibeam echo sounders introduces Calibrated Backscatter data. The update positions 
the combination of GeoSwath Plus and the latest GeoTexture as a unique solution capable of delivering calibrated images of the acoustic reflectivity of the seafloor. 22 Feb 2016 The system, which has been developed as a result of KONGSBERG's involvement with the GeoHab conference backscatter data working group, can be used for reliable and repeatable texture mapping and identification of seafloor types. The data generated will have important applications in marine habitat mapping, engineering and geosciences. Calibrated backscatter map of Barns Pool, Plymouth, UK. The values represent the backscatter response of the seafloor in absolute dB scale. The data can be used for reliable seafloor monitoring and classification. The backscatter working group was formed in 2013 as part of the GeoHab conference series. Chaired by experts and end-users from leading research institutions in the field, it was established to support development of systems that can acquire backscatter data that is meaningful to the end-user by providing repeatable values, independent of survey conditions. KONGSBERG has supported the group's efforts by providing information on its sonar technology and contributing to the guideline document and peer reviewed publications. In turn, KONGSBERG was able to leverage the findings and recommendations of the group to develop necessary algorithms and procedures to produce calibrated backscatter data with GeoSwath Plus multibeam echo sounders. The system co-registers bathymetry and geo-referenced backscatter data in shallow water environments over a wide swath. During data acquisition, a procedure is followed to gather all necessary information to characterise the seabed response at the sonar frequency and to calibrate the transducers beamplots. During data processing, using the latest release of the GeoTexture software, specifically developed algorithms account for sonar calibration information, range and absorption in the water column, transducer directivity, vessel movement, angular backscatter response and the slope of the seafloor. The result is a map of the seafloor showing the backscatter response for the given sonar frequency in absolute dB values.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/new-calibrated-backscatter-data-enhances-kongsberg-geoswath-plus-multibeam/

Positioned for the future,"Positioned for the future 14 May 2007 Harvey Gulf's President Shane Guidry. Harvey Gulf International Marine is in the midst of an USD 200 million construction 
program, including five DP-2 newbuildings and one upgrade to DP-1. ""The only thing 
I owner-furnish on my vessels is the KONGSBERG DP system,"" says Harvey Gulf's President 
Shane Guidry. Harvey Gulf was one of the first offshore operators in the Gulf of Mexico to 
react to the market's upswing for larger support vessels that could complete different 
tasks in deep water. ""We had an alliance contract with an oil major. I would attend 
their scheduling meetings, and you could see that they were looking more and more 
at deepwater projects in the Gulf,"" says Guidry. This foresight led Guidry and Harvey Gulf to invest in two large DP-2 newbuildings 
configured specifically to provide larger carrying capacity for deepwater projects. 
They were launched just in time for a downturn in the market, and for three years 
Harvey Gulf struggled to find the right employment for these vessels. Starting in 
2004, however, the situation changed, the vessels are hugely successful and Harvey 
Gulf is building five more DP-2 supply vessels that incorporate a number of new 
features. Stick with what works ""Every time we discuss new vessels, I talk to my captains. What can we do better 
on these newbuildings? These officers have worked with all kinds of DP systems, 
and they always say: Stay with the KONGSBERG system. The last thing they want to 
happen is to drive-off, hit a rig and lose their license,"" says Guidry. Harvey Gulf's entire newbuilding programme is being built at Eastern Shipbuilding 
in Panama City, Florida, and all of them will be DP-2 certified KONGSBERG systems. 
The Harvey Discovery, a recently commissioned dive support vessel, features three 
DP control stations and several advanced navigation aids including a HiPAP 500 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ position re""All of the DP-2 newbuildings will have the RADius system, which will allow the 
vessels to maintain position even if they lose both primary satellite position systems. 
It's an extra reference system to make it even safer for the guys,"" says Guidry. Guidry lauds KONGSBERG's service and support team, saying that he and the shipyard 
frequently rely on KONGSBERG's expertise to work out interfacing problems, even 
when they aren't directly related to KONGSBERG's systems. ""The most important thing 
for a DP-2 supply boat is the DP system. If there's anyone I want on my side, it's 
the DP guys,"" he says. Booming market With a fleet of 20+ new semi-submersible rigs heading for deepwater operations 
in the Gulf of Mexico, Guidry and Harvey Gulf have great faith in the future of 
the OSV market. To ensure the strong commercial performance of his vessels, Guidry 
is focusing on adaptable tonnage capable of multiple tasks. He told Marine News magazine recently: ""Besides the 'delivery truck' aura assigned 
to OSVs, there's plenty of other things they do well, too. They can make great dive 
boats, or handle any other task requiring the stability of a 60 foot beam and the 
utmost precision in manoeuvring and positioning.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/positioned-for-the-future/
American climate project invests in KONGSBERG technology,"American climate project invests in KONGSBERG technology Following a contract signed on 15th May 2013, echosounders from KONGSBERG will play a part in the American Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), for the monitoring subsea life along both US coasts. OOI is a cable-based array of scientific sensors designed to monitor the marine habitat. Everything from fish and plant life, to chemical, physical and geological changes will be measured. 31 May 2013 ""Given the global climate changes, it is vital for researchers to learn as much as possible about ocean life and any changes that are taking place. This type of technology gives insight into what changes are actually taking place over time,"" explains Frank Reier Knudsen, marine biologist and business development manager at Kongsberg Maritime. International scientists need more to learn more about life in the sea. Now they have new technology at their disposal. Using KONGSBERG echosounders, scientists can study marine mammals such as whales, as well as fish and plankton. They can also monitor climate variations in marine ecosystems, to mention just a few of the options available. ""This information is crucial, for example, for implementing the global measures needed to protect the tremendous biodiversity of marine life,"" continues Reier Knudsen. It is not only along the US coasts where environmental experts are building up this kind of monitoring network. Similar initiatives are taking off on the coasts of Australia, Canada and Africa, as well as in Norway's own Arctic waters of Lofoten.

Vessel launch leads to new training courses at Kongsberg Maritime Ltd,"Vessel launch leads to new training courses at Kongsberg Maritime Ltd 09 May 2014 True North offers new capabilities for training offshore surveyors and survey engineers. Kongsberg Maritime Ltd has introduced a series of new on-water training courses for offshore surveyors and survey engineers following the launch of its own chartered vessel, True North. The vessel will enable Kongsberg Maritime Ltd to introduce a practical element to the courses already offered at its training centre in Westhill, Aberdeen, on the company's products for the offshore 
survey industry. True North, which works out of Stonehaven just a few miles from the training centre, will initially support courses on the HiPAP (High Precision Acoustic Positioning) system. The vessel, which has been customised to Kongsberg Maritime's specifications, will enable delegates to put into practice what they have learned in the classroom. 
Euan Duncan, training manager at Kongsberg Maritime Ltd, says, ""True North will allow us to provide on-water training to consolidate what delegates learn about our products in the classroom.  Operational systems are critical to maintaining an ongoing service, so any down time to allow employees to train in the offshore environment is often financially prohibitive. This new element to our 
portfolio of training courses allows for a holistic approach in that training can be undertaken in an offshore scenario ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ something which will be extremely"" True North has been chartered for one year from McLachlan Marine, which also supplies crew transfer services for Kongsberg Maritime Ltd's engineers. The firm has been supplying inshore vessels to the 
oil and gas industry for a number of years. True North can accommodate up to a maximum of six delegates at a time, along with an instructor, skipper and mate. The vessel is a Blyth 33 catamaran - 10.11m long and with an operational capability 
of up to 20 miles offshore. It has been kitted out to Kongsberg Maritime Ltd's exact specifications and includes the HiPAP 35P acoustic referencing system; C-PAP 34 ROV positioning system with two transducers; APOS computer system

Precision current profiling added to the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s most advanced,"Precision current profiling added to the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s most advanced scientific echo sounder New possibilities of integrated data and operation set to unlock greater insight on ocean ecosystems and the results of climate change that impact them. 09 Apr 2019 Kongsberg Maritime will unveil the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s most complete Ocean Ecosystem assessment tool at Ocean Business in Southampton today (stand N1). The company behind the game-changing Simrad EK80 scientific echo sounder has developed an innovative, holistic new platform which provides cost-effective data collection for improved understanding of the oceans and the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The ADCP option for the Simrad ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½EK80 couples a new, state-of-the-art Wideband combined ADCP and Split beam transducer with the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s most advanced and extensively used scientific echo sounder. The pairing results in the only system for research vessels that is both currents in high resolution, all in the same instrument. The inclusion of the ADCP in the EK80 system enables researchers to also measure current speed and direction as a function of depth in order to determine how organisms, nutrients, and other biological and chemical constituents, as well as heat are transported throughout the oceans. The deeper understanding of ocean ecosystems will contribute to improved models and various forecasts, informing national and international environmental policies. KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s new combi-transducer features four high-performance ADCP beams and an additional calibrated, wideband, narrow split beam echosounder for high-resolution, single target detection and characterisation. The phased array design with electronics also integrated in the transducer housing and a single operator station for both ocean current and biomass measurements, allows EK80 installations and upgrades to be carried out quickly and easily. As the most flexible and accurate scientife, with operation on a large frequency band ranging from 10 to 500 kHz, the Simrad EK80 has become the de facto standard for Ocean Ecosystem and fish stock assessment. Now with the option to add the new combi-transducer and integrate control with the EK80 software, it introduces valuable new functionality, while also addressing the interference between ADCP and echo sounder beams witnessed in standard two-system configurations. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our new EK80 ADCP releases tangible operational and performance benefits that support the scientific community to acquire and combine precision data that will bring even more insight on the ocean environment,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Stene Fï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rsund , VP Subsea Sales, Kongsberg Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have developed a dual combi-transducer that not only integrates wideband ADCP and split beam echo sounder, but also unites the electronics and transducer elements in the same unit.

Innovative new KONGSBERG solution displays Seismic Streamers over AIS,"Innovative new KONGSBERG solution displays Seismic Streamers over AIS 19 Sep 2011 New system improves awareness and safety of marine seismic operations. The Kongsberg Maritime owned AIS and position reference specialist Kongsberg Seatex has developed a solution to display the size and shape of seismic streamers over standard AIS. With this 
information available to all vessels in the survey area, this new development has the potential to enhance safety and streamline operations. Seismic operations in areas of high shipping activity can be a challenge as a seismic survey vessel has restricted manoeuvrability due to the large size of a 3D/4D streamer spread - typically 6 to 
12 kilometres in length and up to about one kilometre in width. Traditionally, chase or guard boats are employed to contact conflicting vessels in order to secure the operation. Kongsberg Seatex has developed an AIS solution to address this challenge. By utilizing AIS technology, the vessel can broadcast its coordinates in the area where the vessel actually operates, 
together with the size and shape of the actual streamer spread. A key element in this concept is that only AIS standard compliant functions are utilized so that the vessel and spread will be visible 
on AIS-compatible ECDIS displays aboard surrounding vessels. ""This shows the flexibility of AIS and how it can be adapted and utilized to really become a great tool during these highly challenging operations,"" says Gard Ueland, President, Kongsberg Seatex. 
""Further it also shows our commitment in creating added value for our customers utilizing a wide range of technologies, and the ability to tailor solutions for different applications."" As one of the first manufacturers to develop AIS solutions, Kongsberg Seatex has demonstrated its AIS technology in many areas. Recent developments include sophisticated AIS receiver payloads for 
the spacecraft AIS-Sat1 and the International Space Station (ISS). These space applications demonstrate how AIS can be a complementary asset to authorities and have been operational for over a year.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/innovative-new-kongsberg-solution-displays-seismic-streamers-over-ais/
Royal New Zealand Navy increase REMUS AUV capability,"Royal New Zealand Navy increase REMUS AUV capability 31 May 2010 The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) has recently contracted to buy an additional Hydroid REMUS 100 AUV. This purchase will bring the fleet to four complete systems. Hydroid, Inc., the leading manufacturer of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), announced today that The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) has recently contracted to buy an additional Hydroid REMUS 100 AUV. This purchase 
will bring the fleet to four complete systems. The RNZN purchased two REMUS 100 systems in 2006 and followed up with a third in 2007. Along with the new vehicle, the RNZN has also ordered a number of sensors and upgrades for their existing systems, designed to increase their operational capability. Since entering service, the vehicles have successfully performed a wide range of military and civilian tasks including location of downed aircraft, police and customs operations and military exercises both within New Zealand and overseas. These REMUS systems came into the public eye last year, when New Zealand was asked to assist Tonga, in the location of the ferry, ""Princess Ashika"". On August 19 th , the vessel sank in open ocean, with the loss of 68 passengers and 4 crew. Following receipt of distress messages, floating wreckage was found by a Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion P3 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. The RNZN REMUS team was flown to Nuko Alofa and taken to the wreckage area by the Tonga Defence Services. The ship was located and identified, lying in 110 meters of water and images were recorded of the vessel and associated debris field. We believe this is likely to be the first time that a sunken vessel, has been successfully located in open ocean, through the rapid deployment of an AUV. The RNZN contract was let to New Zealand Ocean Technology Ltd., (NZOT) Hydroidï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s sole representative for New Zealand. NZOT received the Minister of Defence Award of Excellence to Industry 2009, for services associated with Mines Countermeasures, 
including supply and support of Hydroidï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s REMUS 100 systems. At the presentation to Man""He has delivered some world leading technology, NZ tailored solutions at extremely competitive costs"". Hydroid Inc. holds the exclusive license from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for the manufacture and further development of the REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) technology.

1, owned by Groningen Seaports. The Havenschap 1 has a moonpool mounting configuration for the EM2040C single sonar head together with a dual frequency single beam transducer; a proven concept that is easy to install. The demonstrations took place over different areas including, shallow water with sandy bottom and also with a muddy bottom. The bottom conditions are sometimes difficult due to steep slopes and deep 
water however all the results were excellent. Results from the demonstration showed just how clean the raw and unprocessed (with filters off) data can be when using the EM2040 Compact. Due to the high pinging frequency, harbour mooring poles of 20cm diameter were nicely detected even with relatively high vessel speeds. Itï¿½orimpressive to see what the EM2040 Compact can do in the 
range of 200 to 400 kHz. This image shows Data taken when entering the marina at 6km/h, at 2.8m depth (notice the rope on first pole). Survey over wrecks was no problem at all either. You can even see the railing near to the bow of the vessel on this image. The 45 customers that joined us over the two day demo event were impressed to see such clean raw data provided by the EM2040 Compact, without any spikes even with all filters off. The data is so clean 
that it can be used without further processing, making surveys much more efficient.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2013/impressive-em2040-compact-multibeam-demonstration-in-the-netherlands/

The Far Scotsman , delivered in 1974, was the first UT-Design ship for the emerging North Sea offshore market. This pioneering ship is still in service today as Reliance Star 1 . The early 1970s, at the dawn of the offshore oil and gas industry, saw the very first vessels, designed specifically for. The ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½UT Designï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ range soon became the benchmark design for the industry and have remained at the forefront of the offshore industry, ever since. The UT design range has also developed to include other ship types including oceanographic research, coastal protection and most recently vessels designed specifically for operating in offshore wind farms. In other markets, covering cargo, passenger and fishing fleets, the company has delivered around 200 ships from its ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½NVCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ family of designs. Over the years, NVC designs have covered a wide range of vessels. These include cargo ships and high-speed Ro-Pax ferries, explorer cruise ships and an extensive range of vessels for the fisheries and aquaculture market. Lisa Edvardsen Haugan, President Kongsberg Maritime, said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Over the past 50 years, our design teams have created an extensive portfolio of innovative ships for all market segmentsign.

Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ship design philosophy is centred around three key pillars: safety; operational efficiency and sustainability. Many of the ships designed by the company operate in some of the harshest conditions on the planet, so there is always a laser-sharp focus on safety in all designs. Operational efficiency is another crucial element, with a growing demand for vessels that can operate efficiently for decades. Lisa Edvardsen Haugan, adds: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The most significant driver impacting how we design ships tod owners, faced with higher fuel costs, want vessels that use less energy, so there is a shift towards more electrification and battery-hybrid solutions.

The company has produced a magazine charting the history of its ship design story, including details of some of the significant vessels, key innovations, and the currenn of North Sea offshore oil and gas in the early 1970s, the choice of offshore vessel was limited, with the only options being simple service vessels used in the relatively shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. They were soon found to be lacking in capability, particularly enough freeboard, and seakeeping. The solution to these early challenges came from a small shipyard group on the west coast of Norway. Ulstein Trading (UT), formally set up in 1967 as the sales and ship design company within the Ulstein Group, soon set about designing what would become the vessel of choice for the offshore industry. They looked at specific requirements for the emerging oil and gas operations and importantly, consulted with Norwegian fishing fleet owners, who had vast experience of working in the North Sea. The result was the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½UTï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ design, and the UT 704 platform supply vessel entered service in 1974. More than 800 UT vessels have been built, while the majority are for offsh duties including coastguard, research, and construction. The origins of the NVC merchant ship portfolio It began with a Norwegian company called Nordvestconsult, a design house initially working on fishing vessels and a variety of dry cargo vessels. In the late 1990s, the company was acquired by the Ulstein Group, which was already designing and building vessels for the offshore market, with an established reputation. The coming together of the two companies offered a broader range of ship design expertise to the market. The ship technology part of Ulstein Group was then sold to the British company Vickers, and Rolls-Royce in 1999, then in 2019 it became part of Kongsberg Maritime.

Deep Tow 2000 vehicle. Area of search. Seabed target. Enlarged image of object. On 04 January 2008 an aircraft carrying 14 people on route between Caracas, Venezuela 
and the Los Roques group of islands in the Caribbean crashed into the sea. The pilot 
had reported loss of power from both engines. The aircraft was 24 miles south of 
its destination at the time of the crash and was on its way to a popular tourist 
location. On 09 April Incostas mobilised their GeoAcoustics Deep Tow 2000 side scan to 
undertake a search for the aircraft in approximately 400 metres water depth on board 
the vessel Punta Brava from the port of La Gauaira. The search was undertaken over the area shown in the picture below based upon 
the aircraft's last known position and information received regarding local current 
and tidal conditions at the time of the crash. Due to the versatility of the side 
scan sonar it was possible to cover large areas of seabed using the low frequency 
(~100kHz) sweep whilst more detailed observations could be undertaken with the high 
frequency (~400kHz) setting after targets had been identified. A total of 30.5 km 
of survey lines were run, covering a swath of approximately 750 metres parallel 
to the coast as indicated. During the course of the survey two significant targets 
were discovered and one of them merited further investigation as it conformed to 
the shape and size of the missing aircraft. The size and shape of the target indicate that this target is the likely resting 
place of the crashed aircraft and plans are underway to mobilise an ROV to take 
a close look.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2008/geoacoustics-deep-tow-2000-detects-crashed-aircraft/
New Integrated Solution Set to Redefine DP Reference Systems,"New Integrated Solution Set to Redefine DP Reference Systems 13 Oct 2017 KONGSBERG unveils DPS i2 and i4 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Unique new Dynamic Positioning (DP) reference solutions KONGSBERG has fused its decades of experience within the development of in-house GNSS and inertial technology to create a cutting-edge integrated solution for DP reference applications.

Hydroid REMUS AUV Aids in Discovery of Missing German WWI U-boat,"Hydroid REMUS AUV Aids in Discovery of Missing German WWI U-boat 10 May 2011 Hydroid, Inc., a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime, the leading manufacturer of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, announced today that its REMUS 100 AUV aided in the discovery of the World War I 
German submarine U-106, which had been missing since October 1917. The Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN), which used the REMUS vehicle, located the missing submarine off the coast of Terschelling in the 
Netherlands. German submarine U-106, which perished during the First World War. ""The REMUS 100's compact size and proven reliability for deployment in shallow waters made it an ideal tool for this mission,"" said Christopher von Alt, President and one of the co-founders of 
Hydroid. ""It was designed for operation in coastal environments up to 100 meters in depth, and it has a proven track record for durability and dependability."" In October 2009 the RNLN hydrographic survey vessel HNLMS Snellius located an unidentified object while charting shipping lanes. This was followed two months later by an inspection by a MCMV, the 
HNLMS Maassluis. A wire-guided Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) designed to locate mines, detected the shape of the vessel. The discovery prompted a series of research missions, which employed 
Hydroid's REMUS 100 as well as divers from the Royal Netherlands Navy's Diving and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group (EOD). The REMUS vehicle and the EOD divers descended 40 meters in order to explore the area, where a brass plate bearing the serial number of the submarine was eventually discovered. After further 
exploration as well as confirmations from the German Ministry of Defense and the families of crew members, the submarine was positively identified as the German U-106, which perished during the First 
World War. ""These findings always happen by chance,"" said expedition leader Captain-lieutenant Jouke Spoelstra. ""Twelve years ago, a hydrographic survey ship passed the same spot of our discovery, but the 
German vessel must have still been under a layer of sand. We were lucky to be at the right place at the right time."" The German SM U-106 was one of the 329 submarines serving in the Imperial German Navy in World War I. It was commissioned on July 28, 1917 under the command of Captain-Lieutenant Hans Hufnagel. The 
SM U-106 is noted for sinking the HMS Contest during the First Battle of the Atlantic on September 18, 1917, and also for damaging the ""City of Lincoln"" a 5,867 ton steamer. The U-106 was lost off of 
the coast of Terschelling after striking a mine on October 7, 1917. ""The ship left behind is an official war grave,"" added Spoelstra. ""A memorial ceremony may take place at sea but will only occur at the initiative of the relatives."" ""We are very pleased that Hydroid's REMUS vehicle was able to play a role in this remarkable discovery. We wish to thank the divers and AUV operators with the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group who 
succeeded in this mission"" said Graham Lester, Director of Hydroid Europe. Hydroid's REMUS AUVs are modular and may be fitted with a large number of different types of sensors and have been used to aid in hydrographic surveys, harbor security operations, debris field 
mapping, scientific sampling and mapping, as well as many basic and applied research programs funded by ONR, DARPA and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense. With over 200 vehicles in the field, 
Hydroid is currently the AUV market leader with systems in use by thirteen NATO and other navies around the world.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2011/hydroid-remus-auv-aids-in-discovery-of-missing-german-wwi-u-boat/
KONGSBERG integrates world's most advanced offshore vessel simulator with the world's most sophisticated aft bridge workstation,"KONGSBERG integrates world's most advanced offshore vessel simulator with the world's most sophisticated aft bridge workstation 26 Aug 2010 Two cutting-edge systems from opposite ends of the spectrum collide at ONS 2010. Offshore vessel simulator integrated with the world's most sophisticated aft bridge workstation. Kongsberg Maritime demonstrated the safety and efficiency benefits of its K-Master aft bridge workstation for complex offshore operations including anchor handling with the latest version of 
its Offshore Vessel Simulator fully integrated during ONS 2010. The system on show at ONS 2010 demonstrates a complete anchor handling vessel aft bridge, arranged in compliance with the DNV NAUT-OSV class notation. With one workstation for ship handling and one 
for aft support/winch operation, two operators can experience the challenges of cooperation in a demanding operational scenario - a scenario generated, controlled and visualized by the KONGSBERG 
Offshore Vessel Simulator. ""With K-Master and the new Offshore Vessel Simulator, we cover all aspects of offshore aft bridge simulation, which provides a unique insight into how the K-Master system significantly improves 
safety and efficiency of offshore operations,"" comments Sï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ren Einar Veierland, Business Manager, Kongsberg Maritime - Simulation & Train""We can provide high quality simulation for 
anchor handling and winch control, dynamic positioning with K-Pos, power management, in addition to navigation and forthcoming K-Master functionalities such as cargo transfer and ballast control."" K-Master, which was introduced to the market at Nor-Shipping in June 2009 can include a wide variety of sub-systems for offshore operations, including Dynamic Positioning, independent DP joystick, 
thruster control, machinery automation and cargo control, chart radar and conning display, and bridge auxiliaries. The sheer breadth of functionality at the finger-tips of the operator is astounding, 
and its design ensures that each and every sub-system can be operated safely and efficiently. Due to escalating costs, many possible risks and difficult access to offshore marine assets for 'live' training with real equipment in real environments, simulation under realistic circumstances is 
a safer and more cost-efficient training solution. The KONGSBERG Offshore Vessel Simulator was developed to meet the significant need for personnel training in the offshore sector today. Simulation 
for training, procedures, mission planning, decision support and crises and accidents represent the needs of the industry and are therefore integrated parts of the simulator. ""Separately, K-Master and the Offshore Vessel Simulator represent the cutting-edge in operational and training technology,"" continues Veierland. ""When the systems are integrated, they offer the 
most realistic simulator training for offshore operations available today, therefore supporting the industry's requirements for better trained, more competent and safety focused manpower.""",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/kongsberg-integrates-worlds-most-advanced-offshore-vessel-simulator-with-the/

New DTS system boosting rudder performance,"New DTS system boosting rudder performance We are proud to announce the launch of our new Direct Trunk Support (DTS) system for rudders. The new system transfers the manoeuvring forces from the rudder through the headbox and the steering gear deck directly into the hull structure, promising improved manoeuvring, propulsion performance and weight savings that can ultimately save fuel and help cut emissions. 29 November 2022 Text: Kjersti Lï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ken Photo: @ Kongsberg Maritime The DTS rudder has no upper size limit and works for vessels of any size, from container ships to fishing vessels, and in any segment, from naval ships to superyachts. It ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½eliminates the radial forces and bending moment transferred from the rudder blade to the steering gear. This is accomplished with an extended pipe integrated into the rudder trunk. This means that the rudder stock (torque shaft) in the DTS system only transfers torque and axial loads. Some of the most important benefits of the new DTS systemhip. The improved load distribution gives ship designer more flexibility in the aft ship design, which enables a lower positioned steering gear deck. This gives greater storage capacity to any vessel. The DTS system also gives ship owners the option to choose smaller steering gear, since the DTS system only transfers torque load. The improvement in load distribution allows more freedom in the design of the rudder blade. Higher aspect ratios and slimmer, full-spade rudder designs are possible, which improves the overall performance of the vessel. When combined with KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s PROMAS system, which integrates the propeller and rudder into a single system to improve hydrodynamic efficiency, the potential for DTS technology is even greater. The new design freedom for rudders and propellers together allows for remarkable improvements in propulsion efficiency and fuel savings. Adoption of the DTS system means heavy casted items are no longer needed, which yields improved competitiveness fo weight savings and reduced lead time. Also, the split rudder design reduces the weight of individual components and makes them safer to handle during manufacturing and installation. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Today, replacement and modernisation of propulsion and manoeuvring systems are key drivers for newbuilds and aftermarket sales,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Andreas Malmkvist, SVP Propeller & Shaftline Systems. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½From 2023, EEXI and EEDI will set new minimum requirements for the energy efficiency of existing and new ships. Ship owners will start to look for new solutions to meet the accelerating regulations and improve fuel consumptions and operating cost,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he added. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½For KONGSBERG, DTS is a significant opportunity to cover a larger market and provide customers with a long-term solution to help them meet their goals.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ KONGSBERG has supplied over 4000 rudders to ship owners and builders over the past (+47) 901 81 801",rudder,,29-Nov-22,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2022/launch-of-new-direct-trunk-support/
Kongsberg Seatex Hosts MARUSE Demonstration,"Kongsberg Seatex Hosts MARUSE Demonstration 04 May 2007 On May 9 th 2007 in Trondheim, Norway, Kongsberg Seatex AS will be 
demonstrating high accuracy maritime applications using available GNSS, AIS, EGNOS 
and software simulations to raise awareness of the potential of the future European 
satellite navigation system Galileo in the maritime sector. The first of four MARUSE public demonstrations The MARUSE project within the 6 th Framework Programme for Research 
and Technology Development is funded by the GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA). This 
is the first of four MARUSE public demonstrations, all of which are aimed at demonstrating 
future Galileo performance for the maritime community. High accuracy Requirements of sub-decimetre level accuracy on maritime applications, places 
increasing demands on improved availability, continuity and integrity of satellite 
signals. Currently available satellite navigation systems (GPS and Glonass) are 
in some situations insufficient to reach such demanding requirements, mainly due 
to signal shadowing and non-availability of differential corrections and integrity 
data. The demonstration in Trondheim aims to present how Galileo, Galileo Local 
Elements and EGNOS can help satisfy the requirements and also how Galileo can be 
used in combination with the currently available satellite navigation systems to 
enhance the overall performance. A research vessel owned by the Norwegian University 
of Science and Technology will be used to run a demonstration of a high accuracy

"Island Offshore secures a lean, clean future for its PSVs with hybrid power vessel conversions via KONGSBERG","Island Offshore secures a lean, clean future for its PSVs with hybrid power vessel conversions via KONGSBERG 18 Aug 2020 The Norwegian oil-industry solutions provider Island Offshore has set a clear precedent in the market by contracting KONGSBERG to convert three of its Platform Supply Vessels to use hybrid power technology. Kongsberg Maritime is pleased to announce that it has been contracted by Island Offshore, a leading Norwegian provider of high-quality solutions for the offshore oil industry, to supply turnkey hybrid battery solutions for three of the firmï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s UT 776 CD-design Platform Supply Vessels. Two of the ships, Island Crusader and Island Contender, previously operated with a combination of Bergen LNG engines and Bergen Diesel engines , while the Island Commander deploys four diesels. The conversion of all three into hybrid craft not only represents a firm commitment on the part of Island Offshore to the principles of environmental responsibility, but also unlocks a wealthsed operational efficiency and a marked reduction in maintenance requirements. This in turn translates to significant cost savings for the company. In the past, PSVs have typically run multiple engines to achieve redundancy, with consequent impacts on fuel performance, equipment health and emissions. However, combining conventional LNG or diesel engines with KONGSBERGï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s SAVe Energy battery system ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which has been validated by DNV-GL ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ produces instant benefits. The batteries allow for fewer engines to be running, thus improving efficiency by increasing the load on the remaining engines while also instantly delivering power on demand: ideal in the context of low-load operations such as Dynamic Positioning . Fuel consumption and running costs will also be reduced through conversion of the vessels to closed bus-tie operation. The solution opted for by Island Offshore will operate via a single feed from the ESS ( Energy Storage System )e operators to balance out running hours on generators ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and a 600kW dual shore connection. Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 8m/26ft ESS 896kWh deckhouse will encompass a standard, type-approved, liquid-cooled container solution with air-cooled SAVe Energy batteries. The extensive scope of supply will also involve modifications to each vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s main switchboard and K-Power EMS energy management system, as well as an upgrade of the Acon automation and alarm system. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are pleased to be working with Kongsberg Maritime on this endeavour, as a leading supplier and strategic partner to our business,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Tommy Walaunet, Managing Director, Island Offshore Management AS . ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½By making this investment despite challenging market conditions, we underline our commitment to continue reducing our vesselsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ environmental footprints, and our strong belief inorage system speak for themselves,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ adds Gaute Aasen Augestad, Regional Sales Manager (EMEA), Kongsberg Maritime . ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Applying this concept to the PSV market sets an important precedent for the industry, and weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re pleased to have been entrusted with delivering this integrated technology package for these Island Offshore vessels. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For further information,",Hybrid power; Norwegian oil-industry solutions;contracting KONGSBERG;  Platform Supply Vessels,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2020/hybrid-power-vessel-conversions-via-kongsberg/

med sin innsats, kreativitet og unike kompetanse gjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½r Kongsberg Maritime til en 
ledende bedrift. Om kunstnerne bak utstillingen Frans Widerberg, f.1934 Oslo: Frans Widerberg har nok i lengre tid vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rt den mest synlige av dagens norske 
kunstnere, og stï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½r som fantasiens, fï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lelsens og vitaliteten kunstner fremfor 
noen. Helt siden slutten av 1960 tallet har hans fargesterke visjoner vekket 
enorm interesse. Mange av Widerbergs bilder handler om mï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ter mellom mennesker, 
men han er ogsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ opptatt av enkeltindividet, av drï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mmeren som avkledd og 
ubeskyttet er pï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ vei for ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ste mentale erfaringer. Livslysten og begjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ret er 
nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rmest nabo med angsten og melankolien. Sommeren 2009 holdt Frans Widerberg en 
storartet retrospektiv utstilling i Kings Plaýýte mellom hav og himmel, lys og mýýrke. Hans 
tolkninger av vestlandsnaturen har bidratt til ýý fornye det norske 
landskapsmaleriet i tradisjon etter J.C. Dahl og Peder Balke. Opdahls slektskap 
med Balke ble spesielt behandlet i en utstilling pýý Blaafarve-verket sommeren 
2006 Kjell Nupen, f.1955 i Kristiansand: Alt som 13 ýýring bestemte han seg for ýý bli maler. Nupen fikk i ung alder et mye 
omtalt gjennombrudd og han har i mange ýýr výýrt en markant skikkelse i norsk 
samtidskunst. I 1970 ýýrene var hans kunst motivert ut fra en sterk 
samfunnskritisk holdning. Etter hvert har tematikken endret seg til fordel for 
et mer poetisk og romantisk uttrykk.

I Nupens arbeider kan en mýýte býýde det ""ytre og indre"" landskap. Kjell Nupen har 
vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rt gjesteprofessor i Shanghai og han har jobbet med arkitekten Oscar Niemeyer 
I Rio de Janeiro. En retrospektiv utstilling startet i Hafnarfjordur pï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Island 
vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ren 2006 og ble deretter vist i Kï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½benhavn fï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½r den endte pï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vestfold

GeoSwath Plus Sonars Operational at Rijkswaterstaat,"GeoSwath Plus Sonars Operational at Rijkswaterstaat 02 Mar 2009 GeoAcoustics Ltd (Great Yarmouth, UK), a Kongsberg Maritime company, reports that 
four GeoSwath systems have been delivered to Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) in the Netherlands. The S/V Speurder used in the south east corner of Holland to monitor the Maas river and local canals. Rijkswaterstaat is the arm of the Dutch Ministry of Transportation and Water 
Management with responsibilities including the construction and maintenance of 
waterways and flood prevention. RWS chose the GeoSwath Plus interferometric multibeam 
due to its ability to provide very wide swath bathymetry and side scan from small 
survey vessels. It is particularly suitable for the shallow rivers, canals and seas 
in Holland. Accurate survey results All the GeoSwath Plus installations on RWS vessels are configured with the QINSy 
real time interface (from QPS BV, Zeist, The Netherlands) and are set up to provide 
highly accurate bathymetric mapping data along with co-registered side scan images. 
A requirement during system tests was that the survey results accurately matched 
previously acquired survey data, to within 7cm. The trials demonstrated the GeoSwath Plus 
data accuracy and repeatability. Application As of end February 2009 three RWS vessels were operational with GeoSwath Plus sonars: 
The S/V Speurder is being used in the south east corner of Holland to monitor the Maas river 
and local canals; The S/V Siege is deployed mainly in the Waddenzee (the shallow 
sea in the North of Holland) - its prime purpose is to survey and monitor the ferry 
shipping channel from the mainland to the islands, with an additional task of carrying 
out hydrographic surveys for various ports in the region; The S/V Markermeer is 
located in the Ijsselmeer and is tasked with monitoring the channels that provide 
access from the Rhine, Waal and Maas rivers. A fourth vessel will join the Seige 
in the Waddenzee this summer. Rapid deployment The GeoSwath Plus can rapidly be moved to a vessel of opportunity if required; for 
January 2009 the Spreuder's GeoSwath was deployed on a small shallow draft vessel 
to survey the Maas river when water levels were high due to melt water from the 
Alps. About the GeoSwath Plus Sonar The GeoSwath Plus sonar allows wide swath bathymetry and side scan data to be 
collected from small vessels of opportunity in water depths up to 200m beneath the 
transducers. The system was designed to meet the need for a wide swath system capable 
of high productivity surveys in very shallow waters, and can achieve swath widths 
over 12 times water depth. The GeoSwath Plus provides high accuracy, high resolution 
bathymetry (depth measurement accuracy exceeding the latest IHO specifications), 
and co-registered side-scan data. GeoSwath Plus versions are now also available for mounting 
on small ROVs and AUVs.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2009/geoswath-plus-sonars-operational-at-rijkswaterstaat/

However, its hull system was not upgraded during this process. Given that the hull system was now reaching the end of its working life, with outmoded software and hardware plus an increasing difficulty in sourcing spare parts, an upgrade was seen to be a sensible solution. After studying all existing Safety and Automation Systems controllers and comparing potential upgrade methods, Kongsberg Maritie full-scale replacement of 19 SAS controllers as an EPCI (Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Installation) project. KMï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s scope of supply encompassed everything from engineering, procurement, fabrication and documentation to testing, offshore installation and commissioning of the hull SAS cabinets. The project proceeded with a procurement order from Aker BP in February 2020 and culminated in October 2021 with the successful live field test on the last controller offshore. The project deliveries were completed according to Aker BPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s HSE and quality requirements, on time and well within the budget frame set for the project at the height of the pandemic.

KONGSBERG EM 124 Sonar Plays Integral Role in First Human Reaching Deepest Point in Atlantic,"KONGSBERG EM 124 Sonar Plays Integral Role in First Human Reaching Deepest Point in Atlantic Utilized for precision mapping, the EM 124 produced sea floor bathymetry to map the Puerto Rico Trench for the unprecedented dive. 30 Jan 2019 Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. announces that their newest multibeam echo sounder, the EM 124, installed aboard the DSSV Pressure Drop, played a key role in the deepest solo human submersible dive in the Atlantic led by the Five Deeps Expedition team. Victor Vescovo, in his private submersible, reached the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench, a depth of 8,376 meters. The EM 124 was specifically used to precisely map the ocean floor to determine the deepest point in the trench prior to the dive. The EM 124, released in 2018, is the fifth generation of a range of new multibeam systems from Kongsberg Maritime and is the successor of the highly accomplished EM 122, the de-facto standard in deep water multibeam systems. It is a modular, state-of-the-art multibeam echosounder that performs high resolution seabed mapping from shallow waters to full ocean depths (11,000 m) with unparalleled swath coverage and resolution. It has a broad range of functionality, including the simultaneous collection of seabed and water column imagery. These capabilities save time and increase efficiency during the planning, execution and analysis phase of a mission. The low-noise electronics are compact and flexible in design for easy installation and integration into a vessel of any size.

Collaboration on swimming robots for subsea maintenance,"Collaboration on swimming robots for subsea maintenance NTNU spin-off company Eelume collaborates with Kongsberg Maritime and Statoil to develop swimming robots for subsea inspection and light intervention. 18 Apr 2016 Kongsberg Maritime and Statoil have signed an agreement with Eelume, a NTNU spin-off company, to accelerate new technology that will significantly reduce costs related to subsea inspection, 
maintenance and repair operations. NTNU and Sintef have conducted research on snake robotics for more than 10 years. Eelume is now developing a disruptive solution for underwater inspection and maintenance in the form of a swimming 
robot. The idea is to let these robots do inspection and light intervention jobs on the seabed, reducing the use of large and expensive vessels. With its snake-like form, the slender and flexible body 
of the Eelume marine robot provides access to confined areas that are difficult to access with existing technology. Eelume robots will be permanently installed on the seabed and will perform planned and on-demand inspections and interventions. The solution can be installed on both existing and new fields where 
typical jobs include; visual inspection, cleaning, and adjusting valves and chokes. These jobs account for a large part of the total subsea inspection and intervention spend. Complementing each other The strength of the collaboration lies in the unique contributions from each of the parties. Eelume is founded by top academics from NTNU, Kongsberg Maritime brings in 25 years of experience and 
technology development within marine robotics and Statoil provides access to real installations for testing and qualification. The combined efforts now include an exciting mix of entrepreneurial 
spirit, industrial competence, technology and a demanding end-customer. The result is a very robust development process from idea to market. ""With our unique expertise in the field of snake robotics Eelume is the first company in the world to bring these amazing robots into an industrial setting. Now we take the step from academia and 
into the commercial world to secure our place in the new and exciting subsea intervention landscape"", says Pï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½l Liljebï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ck CTO Eelume. This is a perfect example of how NTNU AMOS can contribute to bringing research based innovations into the market place through new spin-off companies and cooperation with leading industry players. 
Eelume is already the 5th spin-off company from researchers at NTNU AMOS and the third since 2013.

University Students and Researchers Test Own Control Algorithms on Industrial DP System Platform,"University Students and Researchers Test Own Control Algorithms on Industrial DP System Platform 25 Nov 2016 Unique experience for NTNU students and researchers using the KONGSBERG DP system donated to the research vessel Gunnerus Supporting research and education initiatives is key to ensuring a sustainable future for maritime technology development Students and researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) were given the opportunity to test their own Dynamic Positioning (DP) algorithms in a full-scale 
setting last week. The trials took place in the Trondheimsfjord aboard the 'R/V Gunnerus', the NTNU-owned research and education vessel to which KONGSBERG donated a state-of-the-art K-Pos DP system in 
2015. Called 'The AMOS DP Research Cruise 2016', PhD students and researchers were given access to the K-Pos system on R/V Gunnerus for a total of six days, allowing them to fully understand how their algorithm 
research and development translates to real-life operations at sea. It is believed that this is the first time that access to an industrial DP system platform has been provided for research and educational 
purposes, which was possible due to Kongsberg Maritime's donation of the K-Pos system and on-going support of the R/V Gunnerus. ""This DP test campaign is unique. For the first time our PhD students have been given the opportunity to test their own work in real conditions,"" said Roger Skjetne, Professor at NTNU's Department 
of Marine Technology and cruise leader. ""While our simulators provide a deep insight into how different DP control algorithms will affect a DP vessel dynamically, to actually have access to a vessel with 
an industrial-level DP system allows the PhD students and researchers at NTNU AMOS to truly understand the effects and relevance that their work has on the complete DP system and operation."" DP system onboard the R/V Gunnerus. The NTNU's centre for Autonomous Marine Operations and Systems (AMOS) was awarded a Centre of Excellence (CoE) by the Research Council of Norway in 2013. AMOS is focused on creating a world-leading 
centre for autonomous marine operations and control systems. In operation for NTNU since 2006, the R/V Gunnerus is equipped with the latest technology for a variety of research activities within biology, technology, geology, archaeology, oceanography and fisheries. 
The vessel is arranged with a wet lab, dry lab and a computer lab in addition to a large aft deck, and is a key asset in research activities for the university. In addition to research projects, the ship is used for educational purposes and is an important platform for training courses at all levels and disciplines. As probably the most technologically advanced 
vessel operating on a daily basis in the Trondheimsfjord, the R/V Gunnerus is also regularly used as a highly efficient test-bed for technology developed by Kongsberg Maritime. ""It's vital that industry works with the academic sector to enthuse and inform a new generation of engineers who will become the driving force behind new maritime technology revolutions,"" said Arne 
Rinnan, Vice President Technology ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½""By sponsoring R/V Gunnerus and contributing to other education and academic programs we are supporting a sustainable future for maritime technology 
development."" ""This unique R&D cruise represents a true innovation in the collaboration between industry and academia on the development of advanced vessel control technology,"" said Morten Breivik, Head of Department 
of Engineering Cybernetics at NTNU. ""It is also a milestone in the collaboration between KONGSBERG and NTNU, which goes back to 1975 when development of Norway's first DP system started. Such a rapid-prototyping 
platform can prove to be very useful in the coming years when we will focus increasingly more on developing technology for autonomous ships."" Ensuring safety at all times, the DP algorithm trials were supervised by the R/V Gunnerus' expert crew and a team of Kongsberg Maritime engineers. Vincenzo Calabro, Principal Engineer, Kongsberg Maritime 
said: ""This sea trial has been the fruit of a synergic cooperation between Kongsberg Maritime and NTNU. For the first time, we provided unique fast prototyping tools to implement the latest control systems 
technologies into our reliable and modular DP development platform. It has been very exciting to see the state-of-the-art of academic research working within an industrial product. This has been a first 
step towards a limitless innovation."" Rune Skullestad, Lead Engineer, Kongsberg Maritime who was also on board R/V Gunnerus for the trials said: ""This is a typical example of how KONGSBERG is practically contributing to R&D. It is a win-win 
situation, since the researchers and students can test their ideas and development in real life, and KONGSBERG can potentially pick up new ideas and concepts. Together we are actually shaping the next 
generation of DP technology."" KONGSBERG is heavily involved in R&D projects within the Trondheim region, having recently played a key role in establishing the Trondheimsfjord as one of the world's first official test-beds for autonomous 
ships. Kongsberg Maritime enjoys close co-operation with Norway's largest university NTNU, and the largest independent research organisation in Scandinavia SINTEF and its subsidiary MARINTEK (The Norwegian

Kongsberg System Technology is the key to an entire range of integrated sub-systems based on tried and tested solutions for: Within each application, we will offer numerous solutions and equipment types, catering for the same diverse markets and ship specifications that the company is known for. Customers will know the new systems by the prefix of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Kï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ as in K-Bridge and K-Chief. Reduced cost of ownership Kongsberg System Technology provides benefits across the board. With bettengsberg System Technology furthers safe, efficient operations, reduces the overall costs of ownership, and is scalable to suit individual operational and customer needs. Multi functional work stations The distributed and open system design of this sophisticated technology platform utilises a system wide standardised communication network. The redundant network facilitates easy integration of other vessel systems and free flow of information from all sub-systems, with vessel wide information available on multi functional work stations. Additionally, real-time processing has been taken a step further by providing standard distributed process units (DPU) with embedded software, resulting in increased reliability and reduced maintenance costs. Integrated Vessel Management The Integrated Vessel Management concept provided supports seamless integration of all vessel control systems. Bridge systems, that is navigation, manoeuvring, propulsion and thruster controls, are linked to machinery and cargo automation and safety systems by means of a system-wide communication highway that enables free flow of information within the Integrated Vessel Management system. Redundant communication All operator stations, controllers and interface units are linked together via the redundant communication network and a common user interface reduces the risk of human error and the cost of crew training. Though Kongsberg System Technology provides for more integration than ever before, each sub-system is autonomous system and not affected by a failure in another sub-system, increasing safety and reducing the risk of downtime. Embedded decision support In addition to the standard operational modes and functions, various operational specific functions are available to optimize operation for a wide range of applications and vessels. The mode control for machinery and propulsion plants is a good example; operational data for the machinery, propulsion and cargo equipment is programmed into the mode control. Standard and special operational modes are predefined, standard mode such as manoeuvring, transit and harbour modes and special mode such as station keeping, loading/offloading and drilling. When a mode is selected, the mode supervision module will alert the operator in case of any abnormality with respect to the condition of the involved machinery (alarm or status) including standby equipment. Similar embedded decision support (operational guidance) functionalities are also available for ship handling, manoeuvre and DP operations.

KONGSBERG introduces new ROV survey package,"KONGSBERG introduces new ROV survey package 06 Sep 2005 Offshore Europe 2005 is the venue for the introduction of a versatile new survey 
package for ROVs from KONGSBERG. The EM 3002 ROV Survey Package consists of a complete 
suite of imaging, positioning and communication hardware and software, and has been 
designed for straightforward installation and mobilisation on any ROV. (The EM 3002 has now been replaced by the newer EM 2040). The package includes EM 3002 single or dual head multibeam echo sounder HiPAP 500 or 350(P) SSBL acoustic positioning system HAIN Inertial Navigation and motion sensing system Bathymetric sensor Doppler log Designed for highly detailed pictures Based on the proven EM 3002 multibeam echosounder, this new package is capable 
of providing highly detailed pictures for close-up inspection work and detailed 
and accurate mapping, as well as acoustic imaging of the seabed. The EM 3002 is 
the ideal sensor for a high-resolution inspection and survey system for ROV use. 
The system can be fitted with either one or 2 sonar heads each covering a sector 
of 130 degrees. Precision underwater positioning For producing correct and accurate seabed maps, the EM 3002 can be integrated 
with high precision underwater positioning, which is provided by the tried and tested 
combination of HiPAP and HAIN (Hydro Acoustic Inertial Navigation). The HiPAP 350 and 500 acoustic positioning systems work according to the supershort 
baseline principle, and can measure the relative positions between a ship and a 
number of transponders located on the seabed, mounted on ROVs, or fitted to subsea 
constructions. The HiPAP products make use of a transducer with multiple elements 
and apply digital beamforming techniques to suppress noise from thrusters or the 
main propeller. HAIN provides all the ROV motion data that is required for the EM 3002 multibeam 
system: Heading, roll, and pitch. The vertical position component is obtained by 
use of an accurate pressure sensor. When integrated with HiPAP, HAIN will improve 
HiPAP position fixes by a factor of three and will keep inherent drift in HAIN to 
a minimum. Fibre optical telemetry The different package sensors and IMU are fitted to the ROV and communicate with 
the surface mother ship through a fibre optic telemetry system. There will be 3 
computers integrated on the mother ship, one for the multibeam echosounder, one 
for the acoustic positioning, and one for the inertial navigation system.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2005/kongsberg-introduces-new-rov-survey-package/

KONGSBERG to Market Two New Underwater Glider Systems,"KONGSBERG to Market Two New Underwater Glider Systems 08 May 2017 New Deepglider will operate down to 6000m, enabling it to operate at full depth in 97% of the world's oceans New Oculus glider provides flexibility for both fresh water and sea water operations Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. announced today that it successfully completed negotiations with CoMotion ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , the University of Washington's collaborative innovation hub, to obtain the sole rights to produce, market, and continue development of two new underwater glider systems. Ocean gliders are a specialised type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Rather than using a propeller to move through the water, they use fixed wings and changes in buoyancy to achieve both vertical and forward motion. The vehicles move through the water in a saw-tooth trajectory and surface periodically to communicate data on water properties, such as temperature, salinity and oxygen concentration, back to users via satellite telemetry. This form of py energy efficient, and allows mission periods of several months and distances of thousands of kilometres, rather than just a few days and tens of kilometres typical of propeller-driven AUVs. Both new glider systems are based in part on the original, proven Seagliderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ design. The first vehicle, Deepglider, is designed for operation to a maximum of 6000 meters. This capability is unique in the world of underwater gliders, and will allow the system to completely profile over 97% of the world's oceans. The second vehicle, Oculus, is specifically designed for high performance, shallow water operation. Oculus has an amazing amount of variable buoyancy ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 3500 cc ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which will allow it to operate from fresh water to sea water without the need to alter its static ballast. It is also capable of achieving horizontal speeds up to 2 knots. These capabilities will ena""We are extremely pleased to be adding Deepglider and Oculus to our underwater glider systems offering,"" said Tom Healy, President of Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. ""Each vehicle's unique capabilities fill some key gaps in the marketplace and will allow us to provide solutions to meet a wider range of customer needs."" ""It was gratifying to work with the scientists in the UW School of Oceanography and the UW Applied Physics Lab to streamline the process for transferring and then selecting the best licensee for UW's autonomous underwater gliders,"" said Laura Dorsey, senior technology manager at CoMotion. ""UW CoMotion worked through the intricacies of transferring the technology for these complex vehicles and is delighted that KONGSBERG is making them commercially available."" Development of these glider systems was supported by federal grants from the National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Navy, Office of Naval Research.

Robert Allan Ltd. and Kongsberg Maritime to Develop Remotely-operated Fireboats for Ports,"Robert Allan Ltd. and Kongsberg Maritime to Develop Remotely-operated Fireboats for Ports New range of fireboats enable more aggressive on-water firefighting while reducing risk and improving personnel safety 06 Feb 2018 To address the evolving safety and security needs of modern ports, Vancouver based naval architects and marine engineers Robert Allan Ltd., and international marine technology specialist Kongsberg Maritime are collaborating on the development of a radically new remotely-operated fireboat that will allow first responders to attack dangerous port fires more aggressively and safer than ever before. RALamander 2000 in action. The un-crewed RALamander fireboat will offer in-close firefighting and 'eye in the fire' capability that keeps marine firefighting professionals out of harm's way. Fires involving containers, petrochemicals, shore-side structures or vessels can be attacked more quickly in situations where toxic smoke or explosion risk may delay or even prevent manned assets from responding effectively. RALamander can serve as a force multiplier with conventional firefighting assets, or be deployed on its own. The Kongsberg Maritime control & communications system will feature a robust high-bandwidth, low latency wireless link to a semi-portable RALamander operator console that can be located on a manned fireboat, or other vessel of opportunity such as a tug or pilot boat. In common with other KONGSBERG autonomous control systems, the versatile architecture of RALamander's control system will leave the door open to a range of autonomy levels, which are configurable or future-upgradable to suit the operator or port's evolving needs. RALamander 2000 seen from the side. RALamander 2000 seen from above. The first in the series, the 20 m RALamander 2000, will be equipped with FiFi 1 capability with a total pumping capacity of 2400 m3/hr with optional foam. A retractable mast can bring one of the three monitors to a high point of attack for shipboard or dock fires. A range of auto functions is planned for firefighting, including dynamic positioning, water spray target holding, and 'line protection' where RALamander automatically moves back and forth along a line while directing protective spray cover on shore structures or vessels threatened by a fire. A low-profile design also makes it possible to attack under-wharf and marina fires remotely. If a burning vessel poses a threat to its surroundings, RALamander can be used to tow it a safe distance by means of its Grapnel Emergency Towing (GET) system. RALamander's versatility may also offer new ways to maintain and operate a port firefighting asset. Since RALamander can be operated from a safe stand-off distance during an incident, commercial entities such as tug or pilot boat operators may be in a better position to offer fire protection services to a port since personnel are less exposed to risks. Drawing together Robert Allan Ltd.'s extensive fireboat design experience and Kongsberg Maritime's world-leading expertise in control, communications and sensing in marine applications, RALamander 2000 represents a significant step-change and improvement in port firefighting capability and safety. With maximum flexibility built into the design from the start, the RALamander series will offer all the advantages of remotely-operated fire response in a customisable system to suit a port's needs for capability and cost.

with all systems on-hand naturally transfers to other applications, so our engineers re-designed K-Master to make it 
suitable for forward bridge operations created for use aboard luxury vessels. K-Master's touch-screen operation ensures that all control and data is within easy reach of the sitting operator. It was introduced to the market at Nor-Shipping in June 2009 and can include a wide 
variety of sub-systems including Dynamic Positioning, independent DP joystick, thruster control, machinery automation and cargo control, chart radar and conning display, and bridge auxiliaries. The 
sheer breadth of functionality available to the operator is astounding, and its design ensures that each and every sub-system can be operated safely and efficiently. With K-Master as the primary navigation and manoeuvring workstation, luxury vessel builders now have the opportunity to completely re-imagine the integrated bridge system. This is especially 
important in the superyacht and megayacht markets, where style and individuality are high on the owner's wish list. K-Master is based on cutting-edge human factors and ergonomics research carried out 
by Kongsberg Maritime over the course of several years, with the end result offering safety and operational improvements, leading to improved efficiency and fewer operator errors. We have found that many luxury vessel makers and owners look to the offshore and merchant market for systems and inspiration, because they know it's where they will find the top-end equipment that 
will ensure fault free and functionality rich operation. So we're confident that the new K-Master for forward bridge operation will find a natural home aboard the world's most stunning luxury vessels, 
especially since the K-Master design was recognised with an Award for Design Excellence from the Norwegian Design Council in March this year.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/kongsberg-maritime-looks-forward-to-the-future-of-bridge-operation-with/

KONGSBERG Coordinates EU-Funded Project to Enable Autonomous Navigation in Close Proximity,"KONGSBERG Coordinates EU-Funded Project to Enable Autonomous Navigation in Close Proximity 'Hull to Hull' established to develop digital twin technology combining GNSS with 3D modelling for navigation support and autonomy controller input 31 May 2018 Hull to Hull (H2H), an EU-funded research project established to develop technical solutions for safer navigation in close proximity of other stationary or moving vessels and objects, is in its Concept Definition phase and will move on to the Technology Adaption and Integrations Work Package (WP03) this summer. H2H was established in November 2017 to develop solutions using the European Global Navigation Satellite System (EGNSS), EGNOS and Galileo, that can enhance safety in busy waters and during close manoeuvring, helping mariners to take the correct navigation decisions and creating the fundamental conditions for autonomous vessel navigation. H2H aims to create a system that will allow proximity zones to be set for own vessels as well as neighbouring objects, with high precision and high integrity. H2H focuses on solutions for measuring the location and orientation of a vessel and creating a 3D digital twin representing the vessel's hull, which is linked to a coordinate system, e.g. WGS84. This data can then be used as an input to an autonomy controller. H2H will also support manual navigation, providing reliable input for the captain or navigator to make better informed decisions. This could potentially be achieved by e.g., displaying the digital twin on the ECDIS or other display systems. The project is coordinated by Kongsberg Seatex, a subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime, developing solutions for maritime sensing and connectivity. Expert project partners include SINTEF Ocean and SINTEF Digital for broad research-based expertise; KU Leuven, a leading European university and expert on inland waterways navigation; and Mampaey Offshore Industries, a Dutch company specialised in towing, berthing and mooring systems. H2H is divided into nine work packages, of which four are led by Kongsberg Seatex. The pilot system will be developed in WP03, where the main objective is to define precise sensors and communication systems, and develop an integrated solution based on the best available technology. The solution will be implemented using protocols and 3D models described in the concept. The project will also research specific needs related to auto-mooring and inland waterways, perform lab testing of various sensors and technologies and develop test scenarios for demonstrations scheduled for 2019 and 2020 in Norway's Trondheimsfjorden, in Rotterdam harbour and inland waterways in Belgium. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We will implement the pilot system that will form the basis for all three demonstrations. This includes integration of sensors, building 3D models, and implementation of relative GNSS and communications protocols,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Per Erik Kvam , Project Manager, Kongsberg Seatex. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are also responsible for providing the pilorden demonstration, where we will show how we can control the location of the hull on two vessels involved in a simultaneous operation.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The Hull to Hull logo.

Kongsberg Maritime launches new and improved EM 710 multibeam echo sounder,"Kongsberg Maritime launches new and improved EM 710 multibeam echo sounder Kongsberg Maritime has launched an advanced MK-II version of its de facto industry standard EMï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 710 multibeam echo sounder. The new EM 710 MK-II sets new standards for seabed survey by 
increasing range and swath coverage over the original EM 710 by up to 40%. 12 Mar 2015 The new EM 710 MK-II multibeam echosounder sets new standards for seabed survey. Like its predecessor, The EM 710 MK-II is a high to very high resolution seabed mapping system capable of meeting all relevant survey standards. The EM 710 MK-II has a maximum range of approximately 
2800m, a significant improvement over the original version's 2000m, while swath coverage has increased to 3000m from 2000m. This will result in reduced survey time for the end user. Kongsberg Maritime's 
engineers have achieved this by increasing the frequency band used when transmitting from 40 to 100 kHz. All users of the original EM 710 will be able to upgrade to the enhanlacing some hardware and software in the transceiver unit, which enables the use of the lower frequencies. The hardware 
changes are simple enough to be carried out by the user, with no intervention from Kongsberg Maritime required. When released in 2005, the EM 710 quickly set new standard by being the first multibeam echo sounder in the market to offer the benefits of wide band technology and FM chirp as transmitter pulse. By 
using FM chirp the system has unparalleled range and resolution and has become the standard multibeam echo sounder for seabed mapping in shallow to medium depth.

Lake Tekapo Survey,"Lake Tekapo Survey 31 Mar 2016 By Steve Wilcox, Pete Notman and Josh Mountjoy. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) recently carried out a bathymetric and seismic survey of New Zealand's Lake Tekapo. The bathymetry data was acquired with a Kongsberg 
0.4 x 0.7 degree EM2040 system. Due to the relatively remote location of Lake Tekapo, the EM2040 pod was fitted to a trailerable 6.8m monohull. A pivoting bow mounted deployment system was designed which allowed the EM2040 pod to 
be lowered into the water when on site with a high degree of repeatability. An Applanix POSMV system was used to provide position and attitude information with the antenna mounted directly above the 
EM2040 pod. The acquisition hardware (EM2040 transceiver, IMU etc.) was located in the forward cabin as close to the pod and antenna as possible so as to reduce any potential lever arm issues. EM2040 system fully deployed. When the EM2040 system was deployed, the multibeam pod was 1 meter below the lake surface and stable at speeds of up to 7 knots surveying in water depths greater than 150m.

DSME and Kongsberg Maritime Ink New Joint Development Agreement,"DSME and Kongsberg Maritime Ink New Joint Development Agreement 09 Dec 2016 Focus on development of new LNG FSRU regasification control system KONGSBERG Dynamic Process Simulator will be used to verify design parameters Kongsberg, Norway, 9th December 2016 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ DSME and Kongsberg Maritime have signed a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) for a new LNG FSRU regasification control system. As part of the 
delivery scope for a vessel currently under construction at the Okpo shipyard in South Korea, DSME will develop a High Fidelity Dynamic Simulator for the regasification plant. The JDA, which was signed 
on 29th November 2016, enables DSME to utilise Kongsberg Maritime's Dynamic Process Simulator 'K-Spice' and the 'K-Chief' automation and control system for the joint development of the vessel's regasification 
control system. Both parties have extensive experience in the field of LNG vessel control systems. DSME is fast approaching delivery of 100 LNG ships, many of them operating with Kongsrol system 
on board. In total Kongsberg Maritime's rapidly expanding LNG vessel reference list now surpasses 200 LNG control system installations. During the company's long-standing partnership in the LNG business, 
several different concepts for gas handling have been developed. Simulation studies are today established as increasingly important in this field of development, to ensure robust design and to verify 
design parameters. ""We are very pleased to start a LNG control system JDA with DSME as it represents a continuation and strengthening of a long term and very successful partnership,"" said Tore Wean, Managing Director, 
Kongsberg Maritime Korea. ""We have supplied ship automation systems to DSME since the 1980's and LNG ship control systems since 2002. We are committed to supporting their technology needs today and in 
the future."" Vice President at DSME Naval & Energy System R&D, Mr. Young Bok Choi added: ""Entering this JDA with Kongsberg Maritime as a major partner, and to many shipping companies, a trusted supplier makes good 
sense for DSME. We believe it will be a very significant stepping stone for further development projects and together we can provide our customers with world leading technology solutions.""

KONGSBERG repeats satellite success with AISSat-2,"KONGSBERG repeats satellite success with AISSat-2 10 Jul 2014 Kongsberg Seatex provided the payload for the Norwegian AIS (Automatic Identification System) satellite, AISSat-2, launched from Kazakhstan on July 8, 2014. AISSat-2 started its mission delivering 
AIS data only a few hours after launch. When the advanced AIS payload from KONGSBERG was sent into space on the first Norwegian AIS satellite in 2010, it was designed for a lifetime of three years. Four years later AISSat-1 is still performing, 
and AISSat-2 will serve to strengthen the Norwegian Coastal Administration's capacity for monitoring international and domestic ship traffic. ""We adapted our cutting-edge radio technology for use in space with the first AISSat,"" says Gard Ueland, President of Kongsberg Seatex. ""It is an experimental satellite, and four years of service have 
provided convincing proof of performance, and given us valuable experience that benefitted the AISSat-2 project. We have also provided this technology for use onboard the International Space Station (ISS), 
where it has been operational since 2010."" The AISSat system receives and relays information on a ship's identity, position, speed, heading and destination. All ships over 300 gross tons are required to have AIS onboard, and information received 
by AISSat is provided to coastal, fishery and defense authorities. In addition to monitoring ship traffic, AISSat can be employed to assist in detection of environmental violations, provide support for 
anti-piracy efforts and serve as an aid in search and rescue operations. Both satellites are the result of collaboration between the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, the Norwegian Coastal Administration, Kongsberg Seatex, and the Norwegian Space Centre. The data 
down-link is provided by Kongsberg Satellite Services. Gard Ueland concludes: ""We are pleased to have the opportunity to provide our leading technology to Norway's pioneering AISSat program. Kongsberg Seatex is developing this technology for similar, future

Using HiPAP 101 on board the NIOZ Research Vessel Pelagia,"Using HiPAP 101 on board the NIOZ Research Vessel Pelagia The Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), is the Dutch national oceanographic research institute. The institute is located on the island of Texel (in the north-western part of the country) and in the city of Yerseke (in the south-west). NIOZ carries out fundamental scientific research as well as applied science (mostly initiated by the government) in coastal regions and on shelf seas and the open ocean. To be able to carry out cruises on the shelf (mostly North Sea) and open ocean, NIOZ operates the Research Vessel Pelagia. This is a 66 metre long multi-purpose vessel used for geological, geophysical, biological (biogeo), chemical and physical oceanographic cruises. This high versatility is made possible by being able to carry up to ten containerised laboratories and equipment containers which can be loaded and unloaded all over the world. 25 Jun 2014 The Royal NIOZ Research Vessel 'Pelagia' As knowledge about the seas increases, scientists need to be able to place their sampling and other equipment with ever increasing spatial accuracy on the seabed. The sea bed shows high variability and it is essential for proper data interpretation to know exactly where the samples are taken, underwater video surveys are carried out and frames with various measurement and sampling equipment (so called landers) are placed. To support this, it was decided that during the midlife overhaul of the vessel in 2010 an underwater navigation system should be installed. Various suppliers of this type of equipment have been asked to present the pros and cons of their systems. The main criteria that played a role in the final decision were: maximum working depth (most of the NIOZ equipment is designed for 6000 m water depth, so the transponder should be depth rated to 6000 m as well), a large range to be able to find free floating landers at depth, deployment on a pole from inside the ship, size of the transducer head (it should fit in between the frames when hoisted in), ease of integration with the existing ships navigation and attitude sensors, ease of handling of the transponders and the price. After thorough consideration it was decided to install a Kongsberg HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 101 with cNODE ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Mini transponders. The system has been working well since the final sea acceptance test was successfully carried out. Once installed and people are familiarised with it, the system proves easy to operate. However, because the R.V. Pelagia is a multipurpose vessel, the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is not used during every cruise. This means that not everybody sailing on the ship is an experienced user, sometimes resulting in some typical user errors. To avoid this, a manual containing numerous photographs and screen shots explaining the standard operational procedures was made. With this manual at hand, standard operation is straightforward, also for the non-experienced user. Last December the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ was used during piston coring activitieslong sediment cores from the seabed. It consists of a long (in this case 12 m) steel pipe with a heavy weight (1.5 metric tons) on top, and a release mechanism that allows for a free fall when lowered near to the seabed. In this case the core was used for paleoceanographic studies. The piston corer is being deployed. During lowering of the corer the cNODEï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ transponder was attached to the cable at 60 m above the bomb-shaped weight. The white steel pipe attached to the bomb will contain the sediment sample. The horizontal arm above the bomb and white rope attached to it are part of the release mechanism. The coring activities took place on the Nares Abyssal Plain (Atlantic Ocean), about 300 nautical miles northeast of Puerto Rico. The target in the 5.8 km deep ocean was the top of an approx. 250 m high narrowly crested ridge. The target was an area at the crest with a diameter of 50 metres. During the preparation of the coring activities the cNODE ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ transponder was attached to ustom made bracket. In order to avoid any possible damage to the transponder during release of the corer (at the point of release tension in the Super Aramid cable causes jolting of the release mechanism) the transponder was attached 60 metres above the corer. This distance had to be taken into account when calculating the distance of the corer to the sea floor. At the moment the corer had penetrated the seabed, the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ gave a depth of the transponder of 5489 m below sea level. When the 60 m height difference mentioned above is taken into account, this would mean that the top of the corer, which is at the seabed after the corer has fully penetrated the sea floor, should be at a water depth of 5549 m. This coincided very well with the water depth as measured by the on board EM302 multibeam echo sounder, which was 5548 m. Later measurement on deck revealed a total core length of over 10 m. This and the fact that the weight on top of the corer was covered in mud indicates a complete penetrat. This supports the conclusion that the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ system gave a reliable indication of the transponder depth of 60 m above the sea floor. Although the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ indicated that the corer was subject to lateral drift due to variable currents encountered during the descent through the more than 5.5 km deep water column, it turned out to be fairly easy to manoeuver the ship in such a manner that the corer could be placed well within the 50 m radius target area. The corer penetrated the seabed 36 m from the centre of the target. Keeping in mind the horizontal accuracy of the HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 101 of less than 0.2% of the range, this means that the core was taken within the projected target area, so on the narrow crest of the ridge. This was important in order to avoid any possible disturbed sediment due to gravitational processes that are likely to occur on the slope of the ridge. Three cNODEï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Mini transponders safely strapped to a table on board R.V. Pelagia. attachment to the Super Aramid hoisting cable of the ship. In summary: The HiPAP ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ system is straight forward to operate during standard underwater navigation operations. Having a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½pictures cook bookï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at hand makes operation easy, also for non-experienced users. The cNODE ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ mini transponders are mechanically robust. In addition to piston coring, they have been installed on various other types of equipment (video frames, other coring equipment, CTD), also during rough sea conditions.

Greek survey uncovers significant underwater antiquities,"Greek survey uncovers significant underwater antiquities A team of marine geophysicists from the Laboratory of Marine Geology and Physical Oceanography at the University of Patras, with the support of Kongsberg Maritime and under the auspices of the Greek 
Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities (Ministry of Culture and Sports), have completed a marine geophysical and hydrographic survey off Methoni, Greece. 09 Nov 2015 The extensive geoarchaeological survey, which was undertaken within the Evolved GE.N.ESIS (A marine GEophysical investigatioN for marine knowledge and the anthESIS of Methoni) project, brought to light 
significant underwater antiquities whilst promoting regional sustainable growth. A number of historical shipwrecks, the townï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ancient submerged pier and harbour, as well as ruins of the submerged prehistoric 
town were mapped in 2D and 3D with the use of KONGSBERG hydrographic and geophysical instrumentation. Artefact (shipï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s wheel) from a surveyeinistry of Culture and Sports. The aim of the GE.N.ESIS project is to highlight the Blue Growth potential in the Methoni coast and to promote the protection of the local marine environment. The project outcomes are expected to highlight 
underwater resources that have the potential of being drivers for sustainable growth with special focus on the local underwater cultural heritage resources. Regional physical processes, sensitive seabed habitats and development of the underwater environment through the millennia are also being studied. The identified synergies and conflicts between the 
underwater cultural heritage resources, local underwater environment, physical processes and human activities are expected to indicate the sustainable growth potential of the area, the environmental challenges 
and ultimately the necessity for implementation of an Integrated Maritime Policy. The research team used the Kongsberg GeoSwath Plus Compact bathymetric sonar, the Kongsberg GeoChirp sub-bottom profiler, magnetometer and side scan sonar for the shallow water hydrographic and geoarchaeological 
investigation. Methoniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ancient submerged pier and harbour (fig.1), a number of historical shipwrecks and artefacts (fig.2), as well as ruins of the submerged prehistoric town were recorded in 2D and 
3D. The project is carried out with the support of CARIS and in the next phase CARIS HIPS and SIPS will be used for bathymetric and side scan data post-processing, analysis and 3D visualisation of the 
recorded underwater antiquities and of features of potential archaeological interest. The project objectives also include assessment of the extent of the submerged and semi-buried prehistoric settlement off Methoni, the investigation of evidence for its submersion, the description of 
physiography and geology of the Methoni bay, the contribution to the monitoring of the erosion pattern along the Methoni coast and the assessment of its impact on the underwater archaeological site evolution.

cracks and disappear, the crosshead will move downwards. The movement will be detected 
by the proximity sensor. When the crosshead is in BDC - bottom dead center, the 
proximity sensor will measure the distance to a signal developer that is mounted 
on the crosshead pin. The main-, crank- and crosshead bearings can all be monitored 
if a proximity sensing system is installed. However, to obtain the best possible 
bearing monitoring solution we will offer the proximity sensor in combination with 
our well proven range of main and crank bearing temperature sensors. Stand alone and integrated The bearing wear detection system will be delivered both as a stand alone solution 
and as an integrated part of the DataChief C20 alarm, monitoring and control system.

M3 Sonar Surveys Historic Shipwreck,"M3 Sonar Surveys Historic Shipwreck 25 Jun 2014 An illustration of the HMS Breadalbane, a 38m long wooden merchant ship. This April the Canadian Armed Forces and Parks Canada teamed up with SeaBotix to investigate the HMS Breadalbane, the world's northernmost shipwreck located in the Canadian High Arctic. In 1853 the HMS Breadalbane was part of the rescue mission for Captain Sir John Franklin's lost expedition but was crushed by ice and sank in Lancaster Sound, approximately 500 miles north of the Arctic 
Circle. The shipwreck was first discovered in 1981 by Dr. Joe McInnis using side-scan sonar. Dr. McInnis returned two years later in 1983 to document the wreck with manned dives in WASP suits and remotely 
operated vehicles (ROVs), which allowed them to capture stunning images that appeared on the cover of National Geographic. Exploration team with SeaBotix's vLBC ROV. Image courtesy SeaBotix Inc. Working with Canadian Naval divers and SeaBotix Inc., Parks Canada returned to the wreck 31 years later in April to capture more data and imagery using new technology. A SeaBotix vLBC ROV was deployed 
to capture HD video footage and still images of the wreck located at 100 m water depth. Mounted on the ROV, Mesotech's M3 Multimode Multibeam Sonar was an important tool used to provide dimensional and 
situational measurements. The M3 Sonar data combined with the HD video footage provided a much more detailed view of the shipwreck than has previously been recorded.

even further, the WBT can be set up to use any frequency between 30 kHz and 500 kHz, which essentially means it can be connected to any transducers on the market. A standard setup is offered for easy 
integration together with all standard hydrographic transducers from Kongsberg Maritime. ""The EA 440 comes as part of a new wave of recent technology launches including our new multibeam echo sounder and new cNODE transponders,"" said Helge Uhlen Director of UMAP Sales, Kongsberg 
Maritime. ""We are pleased to bring these new products to market, and are positive that the new technology will support our diverse user base, from subsea survey to underwater construction, to operate 
more efficiently and to get better results in a more flexible manner."" Over the past 20+ years, Kongsberg Maritime singlebeam systems have gained a reputation for being highly reliable with the very best performance available. The third generation of the EA 
shallow-medium depth echo sounder, the EA 500, was released in 1995 and quickly became the standard for all singlebeam surveys. The fourth generation, the EA 400 was released in 2004 in a small GPT 
version for two frequencies and has proven to be the most popular system of its type for over a decade.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2015/new-kongsberg-singlebeam-echo-sounder-improves-range-resolution-and-installation/
HAIN - a New Reference for DP,"HAIN - a New Reference for DP 21 Dec 2007 No one disputes the statement ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A Dynamic Positioning (DP) system can never become better than its references'. Automatic control of a vessel's position in a critical operation or location requires good redundancy of all the control system components. Whether it is a vessel's position extremely close to a fixed platform, or a construction platform vessel for a critical deep underwater installation, it will require automated, accurate and controlled position keeping. A DP system is a controlling computer that feeds the thrusters and propellers with accurate signals of power required to hold the position of the vessel, or to move it in a controlled fashion from one position to another, in any environmental weather condition. The DP cannot function without input from position reference systems and operates often with many such systems in an integrated solution. Each position reference system contributes by sending its present logged position datace system has different characteristics of strengths and weaknesses. They are often classified according to how stable they are in position accuracy, position deviation and position update rate. There are many position reference systems available in the market, but when a vessel is alone in the open ocean a long way from shore it is only the satellite based Global Positioning System (GPS) and the seabed transponder based Hydroacoustic Position Reference (HPR) that can give reliable reference positions. Hydroacoustic Aided Inertial Navigation, or HAIN, will allow the weighting of the HPR to the same level as GPS in the DP algorithm. This is probably the best news for DP reference systems in 20 years! HAIN systems onboard Seadrill's West Navigator and Ocean Rig's Eirik Raude have been running with excellent results while the vessels have been in drilling operation in 850 and 2700 meter water depth respectively. The HAIN is an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½add-on' system to the HiPAP or HPR system and uses either tion output as position aiding in an algorithm that also reads an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). An IMU is the sensor in Inertial Navigation System (INS). After years of development and experience from navigation of the autonomous underwater vehicle HUGIN, the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½HAIN DP Reference' is now developed using the same technology.With more than a year of field tests, system improvements and proven excellent performance, it is expected that this products will fulfil a huge demand for improved subsea r",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2007/hain---a-new-reference-for-dp/

Kongsberg Maritime highlights sensors as the key to optimal Tank Gauging Performance at Posidonia 2010,"Kongsberg Maritime highlights sensors as the key to optimal Tank Gauging Performance at Posidonia 2010 07 Jun 2010 State-of-the-art sensors for K-Gauge tank monitoring system. The new GL-300 Radar Tank Gauge draws its high-accuracy and durability from the proven offset parabolic antenna design. Kongsberg Maritime will state its case for the importance of installing high quality, technically advanced sensors in cargo tanks as part of integrated tank monitoring systems during Posidonia 2010. The K-Gauge tank monitoring system takes pride 
of place on Kongsberg Maritime's stand (306/357) at Posidonia, alongside a range of tank sensors, including the new GL-300, that the Norwegian marine and offshore systems developer has engineered in-house to exacting standards utilising the best 
materials, to ensure reliability and long, trouble free operation. ""Posidonia has a traditional merchant marine and in particular tanker focus so our goal is to ensure that our customers and other operators fully understand the importance of sensor quality in tank gauging systems,"" comments Roy Larsen, Marketing 
Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ""The K-Gauge tank monitoring system features high level functionality with straightforward integration to automation systems, and performs to unmatched levels of accuracy, providing optimal performance and operational 
benefits when using the sensors we have developed."" The new GL-300 Radar Tank Gauge draws its high-accuracy and durability from the proven offset parabolic antenna design, which is capable of withstanding the harsh tank environment and is very resistant to the problems caused by condensation and 
deposits from the cargo. The antenna radiates a high frequency narrow beam, which makes it easy to position in the tank. In addition to state-of-the-art design, several unique elements position the new Radar Tank Gauge as the best performing on the 
market; from the inspection hatch on the sensor to a focus on minimising cabling across the entire system. The Radar Tank Gauge is fully integrated with Kongsberg Maritime's K-Gauge tank monitoring and K-Chief automation systems, sharing Operator Stations (OS) and I/O units for other cargo instrumentation. It is a modular solution based on the accuracy 
of the GL-300 Radar Tank Gauge, Cargo Temperature Unit and a Signal Processing Unit centrally located for each tank. Additionally, a pressure sensor is fully integrated in the Radar Tank Gauge to reduce cabling and to simplify installation. ""Regardless of the tank monitoring system, the quality of the original sensor data is still the most important factor,"" continues Larsen. ""Many vessels operate with lowest common denominator sensors, but this could be false economy, as engineers 
and crew may not be getting the critical data they need to ensure optimal tank monitoring. This can cost money in terms of inefficient loading/unloading and reporting, and in severe cases, may become a serious safety hazard.""

KONGSBERG technology helps reduce expenditure and emissions in drilling operations by more than 25%,"KONGSBERG technology helps reduce expenditure and emissions in drilling operations by more than 25% A collaborative, green solution developed between Kongsberg Maritime, COSL Drilling Europe AS and drilling equipment provider NOV is poised to generate major environmental and financial savings in offshore drilling operations. 03 Feb 2021 The KONGSBERG Integrated control system keeps the vesselï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s position, monitors and controls vessel functions and actively distributes energy across onboard consumers. COSLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ambitious ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Energy Controlï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ project has been launched as a means of simultaneously slashing greenhouse gas emissions and substantially lowering fuel and maintenance overheads on the companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s rigs situated on the Norwegian shelf in the North Sea. Having already spent years pursuing energy efficiency in its drilling operations, COSL called upon the technological expertise of Kongsbeen the firms arrived at an integrated solution which combines Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s energy management systems with NOVï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s research into energy optimisation. Analysis of historical data on estimated maximum power consumption derived from COSLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s semi-submersible DP3 rigs COSLPromoter and COSLInnovator revealed that it would be possible to make changes that removed the need to run all six of its 4,800kW Wï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rtsila Vasa 12V32 diesel during drilling operations. While NOV leveraged this data to work on a new software update for optimal energy usage, Kongsberg Maritime in turn used the estimates to develop the most targeted and efficient means of controlling onboard energy production and distribution. A core principle of the joint solution was to limit and optimise generator usage, and it was soon established that the rig would still be able to carry out full drilling operations using only three of its diesel generators, on a tandem with the switch-off of the other units results in radically improved fuel efficiency, a sharp decrease in carbon deposits, and a concurrent reduction in maintenance requirements. The annual figures are impressive: fuel consumption will be reduced by around 2,300 tonnes, CO 2 emissions by 7,300 tonnes and NO x by 125 tonnes, equating to an overall saving in fuel and emissions of more than 25%. The project is approved and supported by the NOx Fund, a Norwegian Government initiative for reducing NO x emissions. Kongsberg Maritimeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s patented DP system technology is key to maintaining the efficiency of the rigï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s installed thrusters, enabling the deployment of a dynamic load prediction strategy which anticipates thruster requirements. The consequent eradication of spikes yields a significant portion of the overall fuel saving. Meanwhile, a KONGSBERG K-IMS (Information Management System) collates the rigï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s performance data and uplo benchmarked data. K-IMS data is at present being used as an informational basis for setting up a shore-based operations centre at COSLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s main office in Stavanger, Norway. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The direct assistance of Kongsberg Maritime and NOV, with Kongsberg Maritime as the turnkey provider of this delivery, has been invaluable in bringing this project to fruition ,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says COSL project leader Torfinn Kalstï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ We can now accomplish complete drilling operations on COSLPromoter and COSLInnovator while using less than 20 tonnes of fuel per day, with scope to reduce that figure even further. We also have the reassurance of knowing that the spare generators are on hand should any changes in conditions or circumstances require them to be used. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re serious about performance and sustainability,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ adds Morten panies such as COSL and NOV. Our integrated solution is delivering significant improvements in environmental sensitivity and operational cost-effectiveness, making an inarguable case for the adoption of green, digital strategies across the maritime industry. Meanwhile, the built-in digital solution for receiving real time performance data on shore will allow for continuous improvement in all aspects of rig operation for the future.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Collaborative solutions for more efficient, greener drilling operations How teamwork between COSL Drilling and key suppliers KONGSBERG and NOV has improved on previously record low emissions to deliver fuel and environmental savings of more than 25% Explore For further information, please contact: Gunvor Hatling Midtbï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vice President, ",KONGSBERG; technology; green solution; COSL Drilling; Kongsberg Maritime; environmental; financial savings; offshore drilling operations,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2021/kongsberg-technology/

World's First Official Test Bed for Autonomous Shipping Opens in Norway,"World's First Official Test Bed for Autonomous Shipping Opens in Norway 04 Oct 2016 Autonomous maritime technology trials to take place in designated area of the Trondheimsfjord KONGSBERG to collaborate with leading government and academic organisations to further develop and test technology for unmanned ships An extensive area of the Trondheimsfjord in Northern Norway was designated as an official test bed for autonomous shipping by the Norwegian Coastal Authority (NCA), during a special 
event in Trondheim, Norway on Friday 30th September 2016. As potentially the first coastal area in the world officially dedicated to the development of technology for autonomous ships, the new test bed 
is set to become a vital facility for the future of shipping. Norwegian maritime technology company KONGSBERG has been integral to the opening of the test bed and will become a major user in order to 
continue its development of sensors, software and systems that enable more autonomy for ships. Announced in March as a follow-up to the Norwegian government's new National Transport Plan, the fjord offshore Trondheim is an ideal location for the development of technology that will make autonomous 
shipping a reality. The area experiences light vessel traffic, making it a safe place to conduct autonomous vehicle trials. It is also home to high levels of maritime competence through an extensive maritime 
technology cluster and several major academic and research organisations, including the Ocean Space Centre, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU) Center for Autonomous Operations 
and Services (AMOS), and the Norwegian Marine Technology Research Institute (MARINTEK). ""As far as we know, there are no such test sites of this kind in the world so the Norwegian Coastal Authorities are taking the lead in a changing maritime world,"" said Gard Ueland, President, Kongsberg 
Seatex. ""We are seeing how autonomy is coming into vehicles on land. I believe we will see some massive changes in the future leading to smart ships that will make maritime transport safer and more efficient. 
We will also see technology that has the potential to enable fully autonomous cargo vessels. Much of this will come from Trondheim, thanks to the unmatched maritime expertise here and our autonomous vehicles 
test bed."" KONGSBERG has played an important role in the Trondheimsfjord test bed, having already demonstrated the suitability of the area for autonomous technology trials. The company's Trondheim-based subsidiary 
Kongsberg Seatex tested various new autonomous technology solutions in Trondheimsfjord this June, together with the NTNU and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment. Furthermore, the AUTOSEA project with focus on improved situational awareness will use Trondheimsfjord as test site when utilising sensor fusion to reduce the risk of collisions between ships and vehicles, 
when increased level of autonomy is introduced. In order to improve detection capabilities also on small objects and improved coverage of the close-range sector, the AUTOSEA project will, in addition 
to conventional maritime radar, include sensor types not normally used for such purposes in the maritime sector, such as cameras, infrared and LIDAR. The AUTOSEA project is headed by the Institute of 
Engineering Cybernetics at NTNU. Partners in addition to KONGSBERG are DNV GL and Maritime Robotics.",,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2016/worlds-first-official-test-bed-for-autonomous-shipping-opens-in-norway/

New wireless video solution for subsea operations,"New wireless video solution for subsea operations Kongsberg Maritime is proud to announce the launch of its cNODE Mantis ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ an exciting new addition to the cNODE product range of acoustic modems which introduces the new capability to stream a live video feed for a variety of subsea installation tasks. 15 Mar 2022 Having established itself over the years as an acoustic positioning system of unmatched reliability and robustness, the cNODE has set the standard for subsurface operational technology. The same principles of technical innovation and tough build quality have been brought to bear in the expanded functionality of the cNODE Mantis: the addition of a live video solution significantly increases the number of applications and services for which cNODE systems could be used. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ In many cases, the cNODE Mantis could be a vital asset for increasing efficiency in challenging operations by supplementing high-quality video from an ROV with acoustic video streamingn a structure which is being lowered ,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ explains Jan Erik Faugstadmo, Product Line Manager, Kongsberg Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ During subsea installation projects, being able to visually monitor placement of structures on the seabed is obviously of prime importance, so in some scenarios it will be advantageous to have a second view to assist the ROV, or indeed to provide a view from an angle where it is impractical or impossible for an ROV to be positioned. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The full potential of the cNODE Mantis as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a second set of eyesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in this respect is easily realised. The live video it streams is transmitted to a receiver installed either on the ROVï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s TMS (Tether Management System) or on the vessel itself, at ranges of up to 500m. As the wireless video transfer works on a high-speed acoustics link it will function in both murky and clear water conditions and is unaffected by bacper second. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½With the cNODE Mantis solution, live images can be streamed from an AUV or drone to a surface vessel equipped with a HiPAP 502 system upgraded with a Mantis receiver, or towards a separate receiver installed on a surface vessel,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ adds [Spencer Collins, VP Sales], Kongsberg Maritime. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Its adaptability makes it as useful a tool for applications such as marine research as it does for the construction, surveying and maintenance of offshore assets. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For further information,",cnode; kongsberg; acoustic modem; subsea;,,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2022/cnode-mantis/
New GeoPulse Compact Digital Sub-Bottom Profiler Delivers High Performance With Class-Leading Low Power Consumption,"New GeoPulse Compact Digital Sub-Bottom Profiler Delivers High Performance With Class-Leading Low Power Consumption Technical enhancements and flexible deployment options lead benefits of new generation Sub-Bottom Profiler being shown for the first time ever at Oceanology International 2018 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ stand D600 13 Mar 2018 Kongsberg Maritime is launching the sophisticated new 'GeoPulse Compact' Sub-Bottom Profiler system at Oceanology International 2018. Designed to deliver highly accurate data while using only 11% of the power requirements of previous generation systems, GeoPulse Compact will be available in two versions; a compact Over the Side (OTS) mounted version and a towed version which Kongsberg Maritime will show on its Oceanology International stand ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ D600. GeoPulse Compact over the side version. GeoPulse Compact is a technically advanced sub-bottom profiling system featuring digital processing and waveform selection technology that enables the appropriateto be selected for the job in hand, whether it's mapping the geology in deep oceans or determining mud thickness in a silted harbour. Depending upon the survey task the user can choose waveforms in the frequency band of 2 - 18kHz, optimising resolution and sub-seafloor penetration. GeoPulse Compact is highly flexible, integrating the best features of continuous wave ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Pingerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and frequency modulated ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Chirpï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ type systems but with much lower power requirements than other systems. The system employs state-of-the-art, very low noise, ADC and amplifier technology combined with advanced FPGA based sample decimation to provide a very high quality dual channel receiver. Massive oversampling of the raw signals combined with digital processing techniques provides acquisition with over 100dB of noise free dynamic range. This allows the system to gather high quality, repeatable data without the need for user controlled lihood of operator error. GeoPulse Compact is designed for versatile deployments, with a range of mounting options available from fixed installations on dedicated survey vessels, to towed systems and portable mounting on vessels of opportunity. Regardless of deployment type, the system is operated directly from a computer using the supplied GP1000 software, which interfaces to the deck unit via Ethernet. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have designed GeoPulse Compact to offer significant new advantages to end-users,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Dr Richard Dowdeswell , General Manager of Kongsberg GeoAcoustics Ltd. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½While offering reduced power consumption the system still provides incredibly accurate data and long mission duration, while its deployment flexibility makes it easy to install on a wide variety of craft, making it suitable for a range of diverse applications.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The GeoPulse Compact sonar electronics are mounted close to the transducers in all depl Data is acquired with the transmit transducer and with a fixed hydrophone, allowing the operator to use the best signal for the specific application. The Deck Unit receives serial inputs from GNSS as well as a PPS input and interfaces to the towfish through a soft tow cable. Power is supplied by a 10-30V dc connection allowing the system to be operated from battery power on small vessels. Ensuring high reliability and durability, the waterproof electronics module is manufactured in aluminium and is rated to 1000 metres water depth. Its internal electronics generate and transmit the waveforms selected by the user. The return signals are received either from the integrated hydrophone or from the transducer and are instantly digitised prior to being routed to the Deck Unit via an ADSL link. The transducer is a double resonant stack design which operates efficiently over a wide frequency band of 2 - 18 kHz and has a flat response over the range 5-18 kHz. The integrated single channel hydrophone utilises 7 high-spec elements to capture the return signal and route it via an inline pre-amp to the subsea electronics where it is digitised.
