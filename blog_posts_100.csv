KONGSBERG successfully demonstrates autonomous vessel operations on Belgium’s inland waterway network,"KONGSBERG successfully demonstrates autonomous vessel operations on Belgium’s inland waterway network Kongsberg Maritime successfully completed a live trial of autonomous shipping technology in Bornem, Belgium, demonstrating the progress the company has made in fully autonomous systems. 02 June 2023 Text: Craig Taylor, Senior Manager PR & Communications Photo: ©Kongsberg Maritime (Martin Giskegjerd) The test vessel, Zulu 4 , an inland waterway barge owned by Blue Line Logistics NV, is equipped for remote-operated and autonomous transport demonstrations for the AUTOSHIP project, which is part of Horizon 2020, an EU research programme. Onshore remote operation centre (ROC) provided support. As part of the test, Zulu 4 manoeuvred and navigated on unrestricted waterways, and it demonstrated berthing and unberthing capability. To achieve this, the vessel was upgraded with onboard control technology, while an onshore remote operation centre (ROC) provided support. A safety crew was onboard the vessel during the test. The Zulu 4 completed a 16.5-kilometre circuit starting from a port in Niel on the Rupel River. The vessel entered a busy sea canal before traversing locks and passing several bridges as well as a yacht club and marina. KONGSBERG technologies used in the trial included Autodocking, Autocrossing and automatic navigation systems. The company has also developed cloud-based communications systems and advanced simulations to test and ensure that the vessel operated safely and optimally. Pål André Eriksen Senior Vice President, Remote & Autonomous Solutions, Kongsberg Maritime “We are delighted with the performance of the Zulu 4 on what is a challenging route through the busy Belgian waterways. The course that the ZULU 4 completed provided an opportunity to test our technology in a real-life situation, where numerous manoeuvres were performed successfully and safely. “The test run provides all partners within AUTOSHIP with essential experience and data, which can help us advance the adoption of remote-controlled and autonomous technology in the maritime sector."" “Together with last week’s successful demonstration of a coastal cargo ship in Norway, we have proved that these technologies are applicable across different vessel types and suited to a variety of operations”. Antoon Van Coillie, CEO, ZULU Associates, which develops emission-free inland vessels, added: ""The fitting out of Zulu 4 with digital technology from Kongsberg Maritime and its testing is a major step forward to achieving autonomous operation of inland waterway barges. This will allow the industry to respond to the triple challenges of zero emission transport, real modal shift and the looming workers shortage crisis. “Kongsberg Maritime is a very strong partner and their extensive maritime know-how benefits tremendously the development of digitalisation on inland waterways”. 
Antoon Van Coillie, CEO, ZULU Associates Under remote monitoring from the ROC, the team and vessel had to show situational awareness, engine and machinery monitoring, berthing/unberthing and manoeuvring in port. The same tasks were demonstrated under autonomous control, as well as collision avoidance, grounding avoidance, transit sailing and automatic mooring. Zulu 4 also demonstrated the ability to switch between autonomous operation and remote-controlled operation. This live trial of the technology follows from another demonstration of autonomous ship technology on May 25 in Alesund, Norway, in which a cargo vessel, Eidsvaag Pioneer, completed a range of tasks autonomously. Both vessels are equipped with remote and fully autonomous operation technology as part of the AUTOSHIP project, part of the EU research programme Horizon 2020. AUTOSHIP is a collaboration between KONGSBERG and Norway’s leading research organisation, SINTEF, as well as several European partners. The aim of the AUTOSHIP project is to test and develop fully autonomous navigation systems, intelligent machinery systems, self-diagnostics, prognostics and operation scheduling, as well as communication technology enabling a prominent level of cyber security and integrating the vessels into upgraded e-infrastructure. The successful test of the Zulu 4 barge verifies the maturity of key enabling technologies and helps build the real-world data required to assure the safety and security of autonomous operations on European waterways to regulators and customers. Europe's inland waterways offer positive environmental impacts by using autonomous shipping technology. An autonomous barge in operation is expected to take around 7,500 trucks off the roads each year and will result in reductions in both traffic congestion and emissions.

Kongsberg delivers 23% CO2 emissions cut for Norwegian coastal ship operator,"Kongsberg delivers 23% CO2 emissions cut for Norwegian coastal ship operator Kongsberg Maritime partnered with Myklebust Verft shipyard to convert three Hurtigruten ships to hybrid technology, with an investment value of approximately €100 million. 18 October 2023 OSLO, NORWAY - Kongsberg Maritime has delivered a 23% cut in CO 2 emissions on the 121-metre passenger vessel MS Richard With , owned by Hurtigruten, a coastal ship operator and adventure travel company. The vessel finished an extensive refit last summer using Kongsberg Maritime engineering and technology and has now completed its first year back in service. Last year, Kongsberg Maritime partnered with Myklebust Verft shipyard to convert three Hurtigruten ships to hybrid technology, promising reduced emissions and quieter operations. The MS Richard With , built in 1993, was the first of three ships to be relaunched, in August last year. The second ship MS Kong Harald returned to service in May, and the final ship, MS Nordlys will be complete in 2025. The project is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, with an investment value of approximately €100 million. “We had the opportunity to upgrade the fleet and give the ships the best of today’s technology. Plus, it’s more environmentally friendly to retrofit a vessel than to scrap and build a new one.” Hedda Felin CEO, Hurtigruten Coastal Express “We have built our last fossil fuel ship for the Norwegian Coastal Express,” said Hurtigruten Coastal Express CEO Hedda Felin. “We had the opportunity to upgrade the fleet and give the ships the best of today’s technology. Plus, it’s more environmentally friendly to retrofit a vessel than to scrap and build a new one.” The refit programme for MS Richard With included installation of two hybrid shaft generators, two SaveEnergy 1,120kWh lithium-ion batteries and two Bergen B33:45V engines. It also has new tunnel thruster motors, a retractable azimuth thruster, and controllable pitch propeller blades, plus digital management systems. MS Richard With, the first of three ships to be relaunched, was finished in August last year. The second ship (pictured), MS Kong Harald returned to service in May and the final ship, MS Nordlys will be complete in 2025 “We can do the full turnover of a vessel in four or five months. An entirely new build takes much longer,” said Geir Oscar Løseth, Kongsberg Maritime’s Vice President of Sales Aftermarket Advanced Offerings. “The vessel is also safer and smoother in the water. It gives the crew several layers of reassurance. They can operate on full battery, zero emission operation; they can run on auxiliary engines and they can run on main engines. So, there’s a high level of safety that meets the new requirements for lower-emission travel along the coast.” Ship owners and operators are working to deal with IMO regulations on emissions reduction, particularly for active vessels. How Kongsberg delivered retrofit results Read the whole story of Kongsberg Maritime and the consortium that delivered a huge cut in carbon emissions for Hurtigruten's oldest vessels Hurtigruten emissions savings retrofit “Our role is going to be to guide customers through this transition, with advisory services as well as the products and solutions that will make sure regulations are met. But we won’t do that simply by coming up with new products and solutions. We also need to look into existing fleets,” said Lisa Edvardsen Haugan, president of Kongsberg Maritime.

KONGSBERG successfully completes autonomous operation of coastal cargo ship as part of EU’s AUTOSHIP project,"KONGSBERG successfully completes autonomous operation of coastal cargo ship as part of EU’s AUTOSHIP project Kongsberg Maritime has successfully demonstrated a range of remote and autonomous technologies on a cargo vessel operating off the coast of Norway. The test cruise has been named one of the most complex autonomous journeys at sea so far. 26 May 2023 Text: Kongsberg Maritime The Eidsvaag Pioner , is one of the two vessels that are equipped for remote-operated and autonomous transport demonstrations for the AUTOSHIP project, which is part of Horizon 2020, an EU research programme. Owned by the Eidsvaag shipping company, the Eidsvaag Pioner operates along the Norwegian coast and in fjord areas where it carries fish feed to ocean fish-farms. The demonstration was carried out over 13 hours and involved the vessel completing a voyage outside the coast of Kristiansund on the northwest coast of Norway. The ship undocked from the port of Averøy, sailed to the world’s first ocean fish-farm, and back to port again, a journey of about 160 nautical miles in total. “This was an opportunity to show the world that remote and autonomous technologies can be successfully deployed on a general cargo vessel, carrying out a range of operational aspects of a typical voyage. ” CEO of KONGSBERG, Geir Håøy “There has been great collaboration between all partners in the AUTOSHIP project, and we have all been impressed with how the Eidsvaag Pioner performed under remote control and during autonomous sailing and docking. “Today we have demonstrated a range of the key enabling technologies that will lead the way towards routine remote and autonomous operation in the years ahead.” What was demonstrated The demonstration was initiated, managed and monitored by the crew from the Kongsberg Remote Operating Centre (ROC) on land in Ålesund. It involved a mix of remote and autonomous operations during different stages of the voyage. For reasons of safety and current regulations, crew members have also been on board the ship during the test cruises. The first part of the demonstration included automatic undocking from the quay at Averøy. The autonomous technology then took control to navigate and manoeuvre out of the harbour and further out to open sea. Here the ship navigated a route between several islands and avoided other sea traffic, before arriving at the offshore fish farm Ocean Farm 1 , owned by Salmar. Various manoeuvres were then carried out using the Dynamic Positioning (DP) system. The vessel next returned to port, again navigating open sea and congested seaways before it automatically docked again. The entire operation was monitored and occasionally controlled remotely by the shore-based captain and engineer. During the demonstration, a number of established and new KONGSBERG technologies were deployed, and included Auto-undocking and Autodocking, Situational Awareness System, Autonomous Navigation System, Intelligent Machinery System, Connectivity & Cyber ​​Security System, Remote Operations Centre and Dynamic Positioning. Cloud-based communication systems and advanced simulations have also been involved to test and ensure that the vessel operated safely and optimally. About AUTOSHIP AUTOSHIP, is a four-year project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement N°815012. The demonstration in the North Sea has been a collaboration between a large team of people from KONGSBERG and the shipowner Eidsvaag AS, including also expertise from Norway's leading research organisation, SINTEF and the University of Strathclyde in UK. The AUTOSHIP project runs its demonstrations in important areas in Europe where the early use of remote control and autonomy is necessary to accelerate the transition from road to greener and safer sea transport. The aim of the project is to test and further develop key technology linked to fully autonomous navigation systems, intelligent machinery systems, self-diagnostics, prognostics and operation scheduling, as well as communication technology enabling a prominent level of cyber security and integrating the vessels into upgraded e-infrastructure. The second AUTOSHIP demonstration will take place on 1 st June and involve a cargo barge navigating part of the inland waterway network in Wintam, Belgium.

This ground-breaking achievement marks a significant milestone through collaboration between Kongsberg Maritime, REACH SUBSEA ASA, Massterly, and Trosvik Maritime. 16 January 2025 Text: Kongsberg Maritime Photo: ©REACH SUBSEA Designed to revolutionise offshore operations, the REACH REMOTE 1 is packed with cutting-edge KONGSBERG technology. Its delivery follows a programme of intensive sea trials, overseen by classification society Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and the Norwegian Maritime Authority. Its initial mission will be to conduct underwater surveys off the coast of Haugesund, Norway, but its potential applications extend far beyond this. The second vessel, REACH REMOTE 2 is now expected to begin sea trials. Bjørg Mathisen Døving, VP Reach Remote of REACH SUBSEA, said: “Reach Remote is an extraordinary journey, bringing together the unique expertise of Kongsberg Maritime, Reach Subsea, and Massterly shaping the future of uncrewed offshore operations. We are thrilled to see the Reach Remote 1 set sail and prepared for its first mission.” Kongsberg Maritime served as the prime contractor for this turnkey project, taking responsibility for vessel design, yard delivery, supply chain management, systems integration, and commissioning. The company’s deep expertise in maritime technology was instrumental in bringing this innovative concept to life. “What began as a visionary idea has now become a tangible reality,” said Lisa Edvardsen Haugan, President of Kongsberg Maritime. “The REACH REMOTE 1 USV is a testament to our commitment to pushing the boundaries of maritime technology. We are proud to have partnered with REACH SUBSEA, Massterly and Trosvik Maritime on this pioneering project. As the world transitions towards more sustainable and efficient operations, this pioneering class of vessel is poised to play a vital role in shaping the future of offshore activities.” During the sea trials the USV was monitored and controlled from a temporary, mobile Remote Operations Centre (ROC) located onboard a support vessel Avant , which stayed close by during several days of trials. When the USV starts pilot operations, Massterly, which is a joint venture between Kongsberg Maritime and Wilhelmsen, will control the USV from the land-based ROC in Horten, Norway. A key feature of the REACH REMOTE USV design is its ability to operate without a crew, controlled remotely from the ROC.

New DTS system boosting rudder performance,"New DTS system boosting rudder performance We are proud to announce the launch of our new Direct Trunk Support (DTS) system for rudders. The new system transfers the manoeuvring forces from the rudder through the headbox and the steering gear deck directly into the hull structure, promising improved manoeuvring, propulsion performance and weight savings that can ultimately save fuel and help cut emissions. 29 November 2022 Text: Kjersti Løken Photo: @ Kongsberg Maritime The DTS rudder has no upper size limit and works for vessels of any size, from container ships to fishing vessels, and in any segment, from naval ships to superyachts. It  eliminates the radial forces and bending moment transferred from the rudder blade to the steering gear. This is accomplished with an extended pipe integrated into the rudder trunk. This means that the rudder stock (torque shaft) in the DTS system only transfers torque and axial loads. Some of the most important benefits of the new DTS system come in the design phase of a ship. The improved load distribution gives ship designer more flexibility in the aft ship design, which enables a lower positioned steering gear deck. This gives greater storage capacity to any vessel. The DTS system also gives ship owners the option to choose smaller steering gear, since the DTS system only transfers torque load. The improvement in load distribution allows more freedom in the design of the rudder blade. Higher aspect ratios and slimmer, full-spade rudder designs are possible, which improves the overall performance of the vessel. When combined with KONGSBERG’s PROMAS system, which integrates the propeller and rudder into a single system to improve hydrodynamic efficiency, the potential for DTS technology is even greater. The new design freedom for rudders and propellers together allows for remarkable improvements in propulsion efficiency and fuel savings. Adoption of the DTS system means heavy casted items are no longer needed, which yields improved competitiveness for larger rudders through weight savings and reduced lead time. Also, the split rudder design reduces the weight of individual components and makes them safer to handle during manufacturing and installation. “Today, replacement and modernisation of propulsion and manoeuvring systems are key drivers for newbuilds and aftermarket sales,” said Andreas Malmkvist, SVP Propeller & Shaftline Systems. “From 2023, EEXI and EEDI will set new minimum requirements for the energy efficiency of existing and new ships. Ship owners will start to look for new solutions to meet the accelerating regulations and improve fuel consumptions and operating cost,” he added. “For KONGSBERG, DTS is a significant opportunity to cover a larger market and provide customers with a long-term solution to help them meet their goals.” KONGSBERG has supplied over 4000 rudders to ship owners and builders over the past 40 years across a wide range of ship types.

New retractable azimuth thruster series saves space and delivers more power,"New retractable azimuth thruster series saves space and delivers more power We are now launching a new series of retractable azimuth thrusters, the ULE PM type, which are smaller than competing units while maintaining thrust power. The compact size makes it applicable to modern offshore wind, fishing, and naval vessel designs in which onboard space is limited. 15 December 2022 Text: Kjersti Løken Photo: @Kongsberg Maritime The new series is the result of a long design process that focused on reducing size and boosting efficiency. The ULE PM type thruster has an integrated electric prime mover mounted very low between the steering gear. This saves more than a metre of vertical space in an engineering compartment. The ULE PM Type is the smallest retractable unit on the market for any given power requirement. KONGSBERG’s designers also focused on making the new thruster series easy to install and maintain. “We took a hard look at our thruster design after seeing the challenges our customers face finding the right equipment with optimal size-to-performance ratios and that work with their vessel designs and operating profiles,” says Pasi Villanen, product manager for retractable thrusters in Kongsberg Maritime. “Thanks to thorough testing, these new ULE PM type thrusters are now the best performing units in their size, which makes them a perfect choice for auxiliary propulsion.” All ULE PM type thrusters are available as a Combi unit, which functions as an azimuth for manoeuvring and dynamic positioning, or as a tunnel thruster when retracted into a tunnel. The ULE PM Combi units have optimised drivetrains and hydrodynamics for high thrust and fast response time, which allows the number and size of propulsion units in a vessel to be reduced. KONGSBERG’s Hydrodynamic Research Centre conducted countless simulations and tests on the new thruster series, leading to new, patent-pending concepts for the ULE PM Combi thrusters, including optimised unit-to-hull interaction and a new nozzle profile.

KONGSBERG unveils range of next generation platform supply and anchor handler vessels,"KONGSBERG unveils range of next generation platform supply and anchor handler vessels Kongsberg Maritime has today unveiled a new range of ship designs in its extensive UT Design portfolio. The new anchor handler (AHT) and platform supply vessels (PSV) have the option to include alternative energy sources and fuels, such as methanol, ammonia, and hybrid-battery power. 06 June 2023 Text: Craig Taylor, Senior Manager PR & Communications Photo: © Kongsberg Maritime (Ship Design) Kongsberg Maritime has today unveiled a new range of ship designs in its extensive UT Design portfolio. The new anchor handler (AHT) and platform supply vessels (PSV) have the option to include alternative energy sources and fuels, such as methanol, ammonia, and hybrid-battery power. KONGSBERG has been a leader in the design of PSV and AHT vessels for 50 years, with hundreds in service globally. The next generation designs for both platform supply and anchor handler share a range of innovations to help ship owners address current and future challenges around efficiency, emissions reduction and developing market requirements. The AHT and PSV designs have received Approval in Principle from class society DNV to operate with ammonia-fuelled engines and they can incorporate an offshore charging capable plug-in hybrid option, to enable emission-free battery-powered operation. Einar Vegsund Director, Ship Design Solutions, Kongsberg Maritime “KONGSBERG’s iconic UT vessels have been the benchmark design for the offshore industry for the past 50 years. These latest designs combine decades of experience and the latest innovative KONGSBERG technologies to offer customers next-generation ships that are equipped for the future. “Our ship designs continue to evolve, and changes to regulations and uncertainty around preferred fuels have driven the demand to create ships that are ready for the future and give owners the confidence to invest, knowing their ships can adapt to meet future requirements”. Martijn de Jongh, Chief Designer Specialised Vessels, Kongsberg Maritime, added: “A great deal of work has gone into ensuring this new range of ships gives owners a reduction in environmental footprint. We have drawn on the results of numerous R&D programmes including hydrodynamic optimisation, assessing offshore battery charging and in cooperation with Amon Maritime, obtained the Approval in Principle for the use of ammonia as a fuel. “One of the great innovations of the anchor handler design offers significantly reduced energy consumption during anchor operations. This is achieved through the use of KONGSBERG’s cross-tensioning system where the load testing of anchors will use the power of the winches rather than the traditional approach of one or more vessels using bollard pull and engine power. This approach will lead to significant operational cost savings, enabling this crucial offshore task to be handled by a single ship”. The anchor handler range, known as UT 7800, will eventually include four sizes, ranging from small to extra-large, with bollard pulls of 180 tons for the small version, increasing to over 400 tons for the largest version of the ship. Anchor handling UT 7800 range The UT 7800 has been designed for initial operation in the traditional oil and gas anchor handling market, but it is very adaptable for future offshore energy developments, such as floating wind. See our UT 7800 range Fact Sheet: UT 7800 AHTL.pdf Martijn de Jongh adds: “The UT 7800 has been designed for initial operation in the traditional oil and gas anchor handling market, but it is very adaptable for future offshore energy developments, such as floating wind. While we are also designing ships specifically for the offshore wind market, the UT 7800 range has the benefit of being able operate at first in oil and gas, then, if desired, it can be adapted to serve operations in new, evolving markets.” KONGSBERG offers a choice of winch configurations and capacities, as well as adaptable chain and rope handling and storage capacity. ROVs and cranes can also be integrated into the designs. For the largest vessels, the deck equipment and arrangement has been optimised for the larger dimensions and weights of the rope, chain and equipment than is typical within oil and gas, enabling operations outside these traditional markets. Platform supply vessel UT 7400 range Our platform supply vessel range includes smaller to medium-sized PSV vessels and larger multipurpose PSVs. These vessels are specialized for efficient supply and support operations worldwide.

Kongsberg Maritime unveils innovative solutions to industrialise floating offshore wind turbine installation,"Kongsberg Maritime unveils innovative solutions to industrialise floating offshore wind turbine installation Kongsberg Maritime has unveiled a range of innovative methods designed to transform and industrialise the transportation and installation (T&I), of floating offshore wind turbines. 06 February 2025 Text: Global Sales and Marketing Photo: ©Kongsberg Maritime These new solutions promise to streamline the entire process, from anchor and mooring installation through to electrical cable pull-in, ensuring that turbines are ready to be connected to energy grids, and offer a comprehensive solution for the floating offshore wind market. The solutions are part of a broader strategic effort that Kongsberg Maritime has put in to contribute towards the emerging floating offshore wind market, with more initiatives in the works. Gunnar Thorsen, Senior Vice President of Business Concepts at Kongsberg Maritime, highlights the significance of these innovations: ""We aim to offer a full package of equipment and technology, from the point the floating turbines leave their assembly site to the moment they are connected to the power grid. Our new methods for anchor tensioning, mooring installation, tow-out, and cable pull-in will represent a big leap forward in the industrialisation of floating wind installation. They are also applicable to other offshore energy structures, so our investment in these novel solutions will also be relevant and benefit oil and gas related operations."" Our new methods for anchor tensioning, mooring installation, tow-out, and cable pull-in will represent a big leap forward in the industrialisation of floating wind installation. Four of the elements highlighted in this new, offshore floating wind approach, are: new vessel designs and methodology for anchor and mooring installation; a new approach for towing turbines to site; a new integrated tensioning concept for mooring lines; and an innovative cable pull-in system. Innovative vessel designs for efficient anchor and mooring and installation Two new vessel concepts, specifically designed for large-scale mooring and installation operations, are a key element in the new novel solutions. The Floating Wind Installation Vessels (FWIVs) are designed to handle the unique challenges of transport and installation of floating wind turbines, as well as other offshore and subsea structures. The anchor handling version (UT 7900 FWIV AH) features a triple cross-tensioning winch system capable of tensioning and proof-loading up to three mooring lines simultaneously with significant reduction in bollard pull requirements. This vessel can pull up to 900 tonnes in a single fall configuration, ensuring efficient and safe anchor handling, with reduced energy consumption. This vessel offers a new approach, and because of the high volume and repetitive nature of the operations, we’ve built in additional rope and chain storage. The whole point behind this new set-up is that you deploy the rope, while preparing the next one, and do it in a safe environment, which you can’t do on a normal anchor handler. Gunnar Thorsen, Senior Vice President of Business Concepts at Kongsberg Maritime The subsea construction vessel design concept, (UT 7600 FWIV Subsea), is equipped with advanced systems for handling, storing, and deploying mooring elements, making it ideal for high-volume floating wind installations. Tow Assist - Empowering safe and efficient towing operations To address the challenges of transporting giant turbines to offshore fields, Kongsberg Maritime has developed Tow Assist. This innovative approach combines Kongsberg Maritime’s leading edge Dynamic Positioning (DP) technology with operational analysis to improve situational awareness, safety and efficiency throughout all stages of the towing operation. Tow Assist builds on the K-Pos DP system, enabling unpowered floating structures to become DP-enabled during complex towing operations by calculating and distributing the optimal allocation of the connected vessels. Successfully trialled in the North Sea last year, the Tow Assist system provides real-time situational awareness through graphical guidance for precise and efficient positioning, transforming the way floating offshore structures are moved and positioned. Integrated Tensioning for simpler operations The Integrated Tensioning Concept is a solution designed to enhance the efficiency and safety of mooring line hook-up operations. This system compensates for relative movements between the floater and the vessel, significantly increasing the operational weather window and ensuring smoother operations. The new concept utilises Kongsberg Maritime's advanced Permanent Magnet (PM) winches, known for their high torque and dynamic capabilities. These winches are a key component of the system, providing the responsiveness and motion compensation necessary for precise and efficient tensioning of mooring lines. The PM winches' ability to handle large loads with rapid response makes them ideal for the challenging conditions of offshore operations. The Integrated Tensioning Concept monitors the motion of the floater, allowing the vessel winch to compensate, removing peak loads and hazardous situations. This results in a much smoother hook-up process and significantly increases the operational weather window Runar Hjelle, Sales Director Offshore Construction & Support at Kongsberg Maritime Innovative cable pull-in for year-round operations A new method for cable pull-in operations, is a key element of Kongsberg Maritime’s end-to-end process by reducing requirements for equipment and people on the floater, enhancing safety and speeding up the overall rate of installation of the wind farm array. Gunnar Thorsen, adds: “At present, cable pull-in operations require mobilising equipment such as winches, power packs and fuel tanks on the floating turbine. Personnel must be on board the floater after it has been hooked up to perform the cable pull-in. However, with the new, patented method, all necessary equipment is placed on the vessel, significantly reducing the complexity and risk associated with the operation. “This new approach offers several advantages, including enhanced safety by reducing the number of people onboard the floater, to a minimum during the pull-in operation. Equipment lifting operations and personnel transfer are minimised which allows operations to continue in harsher weather conditions. This is crucial for maintaining year-round productivity and speeds up the overall rate of installation of the wind farm array.” Powering sustainability Kongsberg Maritime unveils innovative solutions transforming floating offshore wind installations.

Kongsberg Maritime celebrates 50 years of ship design,"Kongsberg Maritime celebrates 50 years of ship design With 50 years of experience designing vessels for the toughest conditions and 1000 designs built, Kongsberg Maritime’s Ship Design team is now focused on a zero-emissions future in the maritime industry 11 April 2024 Kongsberg Maritime celebrates 50 years since its first ship designs entered service. From setting the benchmark that set the standard for offshore supply vessels in the 1970s, to advanced anchor handlers that transformed the oil and gas industry, and a growing reference list in fishery and merchant ships, Kongsberg Maritime’s range of ship designs has continued to evolve over the past five decades. The Far Scotsman , delivered in 1974, was the first UT-Design ship for the emerging North Sea offshore market. This pioneering ship is still in service today as Reliance Star 1 . The early 1970s, at the dawn of the offshore oil and gas industry, saw the very first vessels, designed specifically for the harsh operating conditions of the North Sea. The ‘UT Design’ range soon became the benchmark design for the industry and have remained at the forefront of the offshore industry, ever since. The UT design range has also developed to include other ship types including oceanographic research, coastal protection and most recently vessels designed specifically for operating in offshore wind farms. In other markets, covering cargo, passenger and fishing fleets, the company has delivered around 200 ships from its ‘NVC’ family of designs. Over the years, NVC designs have covered a wide range of vessels. These include cargo ships and high-speed Ro-Pax ferries, explorer cruise ships and an extensive range of vessels for the fisheries and aquaculture market. Lisa Edvardsen Haugan, President Kongsberg Maritime, said: “Over the past 50 years, our design teams have created an extensive portfolio of innovative ships for all market segments.  As we reach our fiftieth year, we’re delighted to report that we will also soon be delivering our 1,000th ship design. IWS Skywalker is the latest Kongsberg Maritime vessel design. It is a state-of-the art windfarm commissioning service operation vessel (CSOV) due to start operations in the North Sea. “In the same way as the very first UT 704 platform supply vessel ventured out into the North Sea back in 1974 as a pioneer of its time, our latest state-of-the art windfarm service operation vessels (CSOV) - a fleet of six ‘Skywalker Class’ UT5519 DE for Integrated Wind Solutions - will again be pioneering operations in the energy markets offshore”. ""Owners, faced with higher fuel costs, want vessels that use less energy, so there is a shift towards more electrification and battery-hybrid solutions. The use of alternative fuels is also very relevant for how ships are designed, such as methanol and ammonia fuelled ships"" Lisa Edvardsen Haugan President, Kongsberg Maritime “We are a technology company that delivers a wealth of innovative solutions and technologies, which we incorporate into our ship designs. That combined knowledge across the company, together deep and lasting relationships with ship owners, many of which are based in Norway, gives us a unique capability to offer modern solutions in an efficient way”. Kongsberg Maritime’s ship design philosophy is centred around three key pillars: safety; operational efficiency and sustainability. Many of the ships designed by the company operate in some of the harshest conditions on the planet, so there is always a laser-sharp focus on safety in all designs. Operational efficiency is another crucial element, with a growing demand for vessels that can operate efficiently for decades. Lisa Edvardsen Haugan, adds: “The most significant driver impacting how we design ships today, is sustainability. It’s not only regulators that are demanding ships have lower emissions, owners, faced with higher fuel costs, want vessels that use less energy, so there is a shift towards more electrification and battery-hybrid solutions. The use of alternative fuels is also very relevant for how ships are designed, such as methanol and ammonia fuelled ships”. New PSV and AHTS designs - The latest platform supply and anchor handler designs from Kongsberg Maritime feature innovative technologies and can operate on alternative fuels, including methanol and ammonia The Kongsberg Maritime ship design team is based in Hjørungavåg and Aalesund on the west coast of Norway, and is supported by a Kongsberg-owned Croatian company, Navis Consult, which provides a range of engineering services in support of the company’s products and ship design projects. The company has produced a magazine charting the history of its ship design story, including details of some of the significant vessels, key innovations, and the current and future designs. It can be read here. UT – an offshore pioneer At the dawn of North Sea offshore oil and gas in the early 1970s, the choice of offshore vessel was limited, with the only options being simple service vessels used in the relatively shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. They were soon found to be lacking in capability, particularly enough freeboard, and seakeeping. The solution to these early challenges came from a small shipyard group on the west coast of Norway. Ulstein Trading (UT), formally set up in 1967 as the sales and ship design company within the Ulstein Group, soon set about designing what would become the vessel of choice for the offshore industry. They looked at specific requirements for the emerging oil and gas operations and importantly, consulted with Norwegian fishing fleet owners, who had vast experience of working in the North Sea. The result was the ‘UT’ design, and the UT 704 platform supply vessel entered service in 1974. More than 800 UT vessels have been built, while the majority are for offshore operations, the design has evolved for other duties including coastguard, research, and construction. The origins of the NVC merchant ship portfolio It began with a Norwegian company called Nordvestconsult, a design house initially working on fishing vessels and a variety of dry cargo vessels. In the late 1990s, the company was acquired by the Ulstein Group, which was already designing and building vessels for the offshore market, with an established reputation. The coming together of the two companies offered a broader range of ship design expertise to the market. The ship technology part of Ulstein Group was then sold to the British company Vickers, and Rolls-Royce in 1999, then in 2019 it became part of Kongsberg Maritime.

Kongsberg Maritime develops innovative Mooring Capable Solution for Offshore Construction Vessels,"Kongsberg Maritime develops innovative Mooring Capable Solution for Offshore Construction Vessels Kongsberg Maritime has developed an innovative mooring capable solution for Offshore Construction Vessels (OSCVs), expanding the capabilities of OSCVs beyond their current scope to include the pre-lay of mooring lines as a natural extension to original suction anchor capabilities. 13 February 2025 Text: Global Sales and Marketing Photo: ©Kongsberg Maritime By integrating a purpose designed anchor handling winch , shark jaws and stern rollers into the design of OSCVs at the newbuild stage, vessel owners can now equip their ships to perform a broader range of mooring operations. This advancement allows OSCVs to handle more tasks independently, filling the shortage of vessels capable of large-scale mooring installations . Key Benefits of the Mooring Capable Solution: Enhanced Operational Window: The new system allows OSCVs to carry out a larger portion of mooring operations, extending their operational window and reducing the need for additional vessels at the field. Cost Efficiency: By expanding the operational capabilities of OSCVs, significant synergies can be achieved for the field developer. Safety and Efficiency: The addition of winches and stern rollers enables safer and more efficient over-stern deployment of mooring lines, a method commonly used by AHTS vessels. Flexible Installation Options: The winch can either be permanently installed or portable and loaded on board only when needed. The shark jaws and stern rollers are permanently fitted to the ship. Versatile Equipment: The subsea crane, a common feature of OSCVs, can lift and install suction piles, as well as hold the load of mooring chain. The winch package includes one drum for work wire and two cable lifters for handling chain. In combination with superior DP capabilities and a large deck area that makes for an efficient installation vessel With regards to field development and mooring installation, OSCVs are currently limited to setting large suction piles or driven piles into the seabed using onboard cranes and ROVs, without requiring additional vessel equipment. While some mooring lines can be installed using ad hoc methods, the new solution from Kongsberg Maritime means that OSCVs can perform these tasks safer and more efficiently. There will be a lack of vessels with subsea crane and sufficient deck area suited to support the planned high volume of both large anchors and mooring lines in the years to come. With the addition of this system, OSCVs become a more attractive and efficient solution, especially when there is a shortage of specialised mooring installation vessels. Runar Hjelle, Sales Director, Offshore Construction & Support Kongsberg Maritime “The Kongsberg proposed adjustments to construction vessel newbuilds will position them to take on a larger portion of mooring line installations. These vessels have synergies with other field development activities, so the message to owners is why not make your construction vessels Mooring Installation Capable?” With the new space-saving Kongsberg Maritime system, OSCVs are prepared for the installation of anchors and pre-lay of mooring lines (both chain and fibre rope) without compromising on their construction capabilities.

Kongsberg Maritime’s Promas propulsion system now available for navy vessels,"Kongsberg Maritime’s Promas propulsion system now available for navy vessels The Promas propeller and rudder system delivers increased fuel efficiency, better manoeuvrability and extended range for naval platforms 12 September 2023 Text: Craig Taylor Photo: @Kongsberg Maritime Kongsberg Maritime has concluded a research programme that shows its Promas propeller and rudder system can deliver a host of benefits for naval platforms including significant fuel savings, greater range and improved manoeuvrability. Originally designed for commercial ships, Promas combines rudder and propeller into one propulsion system Originally designed for commercial ships, Promas combines rudder and propeller into one propulsion system. Most naval twin-screw vessels use conventional rudders placed off-centre from the shaft centreline. Promas can deliver fuel savings of more than 5% which can translate into increased range, boosting the capability of naval platforms. The research, carried out by Kongsberg’s Hydrodynamic Research Centre (HRC), has shown that naval vessels relying on traditional rudder and propeller systems can increase their efficiency and manoeuvrability with the adoption of the Promas propeller and rudder system. Kongsberg Maritime’s Promas System delivers fuel savings of more than 5% The HRC tested and compared the Promas bulb-rudder system, and the conventional off-centre rudder system used by navies on a typical naval aft ship dummy design. The dummy design consisted of an open shaft configuration with V-bracket and high shaft inclination angle to produce a typical wake field for a naval twin screw vessel. The tests compared propulsive efficiency, rudder forces, cavitation inception speed, cavitation, pressure pulses, and noise levels between Promas and conventional navy propulsion for ship speeds up to 25 knots. At 25 knots, the Promas system reduced power consumption by 6%. The rudder forces with Promas are also much higher. The system demonstrated less drag at small rudder angles and a higher lift at larger angles than a conventional navy system. This improves slow speed and harbour manoeuvring. “We’ve known for many years how Promas brings a quick improvement in efficiency for commercial operators, and this latest research demonstrates how these benefits can be offered to our governmental customers"" Patrik Kron Chief of Naval Systems, Kongsberg Maritime Patrik Kron, Kongsberg Maritime’s Chief of Naval Systems, said: “We’ve known for many years how Promas brings a quick improvement in efficiency for commercial operators, and this latest research demonstrates how these benefits can be offered to our governmental customers. “By being able to demonstrate an improved efficiency of around 6%, for navies this means their vessels are able to extend their range, something which can be crucial on longer missions. “We know there is a large market for grey and light grey ships operating up to 25 knots, so our initial research has focussed on that speed range, but we’re continuing our research to consider how Promas could enhance the operational capability of combatants which operate at up to 30 knots”.

Kongsberg Maritime takes another step towards autonomous vessel operation with approval to move Chief Engineer role to shore,"Kongsberg Maritime takes another step towards autonomous vessel operation with approval to move Chief Engineer role to shore The move will enable the role of Chief Engineer to be located in a Remote Operations Centre (ROC), where the duties can be carried out from a desk-based workstation, instead of onboard a vessel. 13 June 2024 Kongsberg Maritime has received Approval in Principle from classification society DNV to enable a key role to be transferred from a ship to a shore-based control centre, marking a significant step in the journey towards uncrewed vessel operations. The move will enable the role of Chief Engineer to be located in a Remote Operations Centre (ROC), where the duties can be carried out from a desk-based workstation, instead of onboard a vessel. From the workstation, the Chief Engineer will be able to monitor and control systems including the Power Management System, ballast water system and deck machinery on three vessels. They are the world’s first fully electric container vessel Yara Birkeland; and a pair of electric barges operated by Norwegian grocery retailer ASKO, named Marit and Therese . ""The role of Chief Engineer is one which already involves a lot of monitoring of automation and control systems on board. For this trial, moving this functionality to the shore-based ROC will see one person now managing a range of systems across three vessels, rather than one"" Pål André Eriksen SVP Remote & Autonomous Solutions, Kongsberg Maritime Full approval for what’s known as ‘Chief-to-Shore’ functionality is expected to be granted later this year, once a period of testing has taken place, overseen by DNV and the Norwegian Maritime Authority. It is a step that can help address the industry-wide shortage of seafarers and make vessel operations safer and more efficient. Pål André Eriksen, Kongsberg Maritime, SVP Remote & Autonomous Solutions, said: “The journey towards autonomous, and uncrewed operation of vessels is defined by a set of increments. To get there, we must take each step in-turn and prove the functionality and value before moving to the next. The role of Chief Engineer is one which already involves a lot of monitoring of automation and control systems on board. For this trial, moving this functionality to the shore-based ROC will see one person now managing a range of systems across three vessels, rather than one. A pair of electric barges operated by Norwegian grocery retailer ASKO, named Marit and Therese, will be part of the test overseen by DNV and the Norwegian Maritime Authority. “This is a significant and exciting realisation, and we’re pleased to have received Approval in Principle from DNV. There has been great collaboration from Yara, ASKO, DNV and the Norwegian Maritime Authority, to enable this functionality to be switched from ship to shore, and we look forward to testing this latest innovative approach to transforming vessel operations.” ""We believe this is a key step for Kongsberg Maritime’s pathway to fully autonomous vessels, but also a technology that could contribute to a safer and more efficient world fleet by providing remote support for maintenance, troubleshooting as well as expertise on new alternative fuels that may be hard to get onboard every vessel"" Jarle Coll Blomhoff DNV Head of Section Digital Ship Systems “Developing new vessel systems that will support autonomous and remote operation of vessels is a challenging task, and we are happy that Kongsberg Maritime has decided team up with DNV to ensure that safety of the new solution is thoroughly verified,” says DNV Head of Section Digital Ship Systems, Jarle Coll Blomhoff. “Remote machinery support is a first natural step on the path to autonomy as the engineering functions onboard a vessel are in many ways already automated. We believe this is a key step for Kongsberg Maritime’s pathway to fully autonomous vessels, but also a technology that could contribute to a safer and more efficient world fleet by providing remote support for maintenance, troubleshooting as well as expertise on new alternative fuels that may be hard to get onboard every vessel.” Testing will be conducted this summer and will involve the shore-based technician managing a number of tasks on three vessels, all managed remotely from shore. From the ROC, an ‘aggregated view’ of the three vessels will be visible at all times, and if an issue arises or an intervention is required on one of the vessels, the system will manually switch to ‘high attention mode’ focussing operator attention where support is needed. Alongside the Chief Engineer, other crew members, such as the Master and Navigator, will remain on the vessels throughout the tests, and in constant contact through radio and CCTV connections, until full approval of the Chief-to-Shore functionality has been granted. During the qualification process Kongsberg Maritime will be following DNV’s class guidelines for Autonmous and Remotely Operated Ships (DNV-CG-0294) and Remote Engineering Monitoring and Control Systems (REMC), prior to full approval being granted. The ROC in Horten, Norway, is a facility manged by Massterly, a joint venture between Kongsberg Maritime and Wilhelmsen. The ROC is currently at the forefront of pioneering new methods of operation for vessels equipped with remote and autonomous vessels and was recently expanded to five workstations to meet customer demand.

"Kongsberg Maritime launches EcoAdvisor™, a powerful decision support tool for vessel optimisation","Kongsberg Maritime launches EcoAdvisor™, a powerful decision support tool for vessel optimisation Kongsberg Maritime has launched EcoAdvisor™ , an intelligent and dynamic decision support system for optimizing a range of vessel operations. 30 August 2022 Text: Gunvor Hatling Midtbø, VP Communication Photo: @Kongsberg Maritime EcoAdvisor™ is an outcome of a joint ‘Intelligent Efficiency’ research project between Kongsberg Maritime, vessel operator DOF Subsea AS (DOF), Sintef, NORCE and Innovation Norway, with the aim of developing technologies to monitor and reduce the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions during vessel operations. EcoAdvisor™ monitors the vessel operation and its environment, including power generation, propulsion, environmental forces and control system dynamics. EcoAdvisor™ enables operators to achieve reductions in fuel, emissions and maintenance costs, without compromising vessel redundancy margins or vessel operational efficiency. With stricter regulations and a global need for industry to operate as sustainably as possible, EcoAdvisor™ provides live advice on how ship owners can reduce their carbon footprint whilst at the same time reducing OPEX. “EcoAdvisor™ demonstrates clearly how a decision support tool relying on the power of digitization can help vessel operators remain competitive in a growing green market. Several factors contribute to inefficiencies in maritime operations, such as multiple engines running at low utilisation, load variations, and large power fluctuations due to mission equipment and thrusters. Vessel owners have found it challenging to achieve sustainable operations due to conservative requirements from charters and a lack of a holistic overview of their operations.” Odd Hagen, VP Offshore Sales, Kongsberg Maritime. “ EcoAdvisor™ creates an intelligent and comprehensive overview of all these factors, delivering advice that enables efficient, cost-effective and sustainable solutions to be made without compromising vessel redundancy margin. Further, the history log and reporting functions in EcoAdvisor™ can be used to determine the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI), the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) to ensure compliance with the IMO.” EcoAdvisor™ works by collecting and analysing real-time data from various systems onboard. These include dynamic positioning (DP) , integrated automation systems (IAS), navigation and power management systems (PMS). This data is passed through a non-linear optimisation solver to find the optimal set up of the power plant for the current environmental conditions, considering the demand from various consumers including thrusters, mission equipment and hotel loads. The optimal load reference for engines and state of charge reference for batteries is computed based on their efficiency and power loss. Based on this analysis, operational advice is provided to the Captain, DP operator and Chief Engineer as to what machinery (engines, batteries and thrusters) can be stopped to run the vessel more efficiently and sustainably. This advice is dynamic – if a change in the mean weather conditions (wind, wave and current), power plant system or DP system settings is detected, EcoAdvisor’s recommendations will be revised accordingly. All advice is backed up by a system overview indicating why these changes are desirable, how any steps will alter the balance between efficiency and redundancy margin, and what the real-time effect of the measures are. EcoAdvisor™ includes a Voyage Energy Calculator (VEC) feature for transit operation. This helps the operator to determine the total energy consumption for varying speed profiles including added resistance due to wind, wave and current for selected routes based on the weather forecast. This allows operators to decide the optimal speed with minimum fuel energy consumption for a specific trip, according to their departure/arrival time requirements. Utilizing EcoAdvisor’s innovative features on the optimisation of the use of generators, thrusters, and the setup of the power plant, while maintaining and ensuring safety during DP operations, DOF currently has ‘Intelligent Efficiency’ pilot schemes running on two vessels ( Skandi Vega & Skandi Africa ) and are expecting positive data from these. ""We see there is potential for both savings and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and if the result from the pilot vessels is as expected, we anticipate that this will be installed on a larger part of our fleet”, Arnstein Kløvrud SVP Technology & Integrated Solutions at DOF EcoAdvisor™ Powerful decision support tool for vessel optimisation See how it works For further information, please contact: Gunvor Hatling Midtbø Vice President, Communications +47 99 21 42 09 Read more",EcoAdvisor™,,30 August 2022,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2022/kongsberg-maritime-launches-ecoadvisor/

"Kongsberg Maritime announces groundbreaking, fuel efficient bulker design","Kongsberg Maritime announces groundbreaking, fuel efficient bulker design The design is based on a Kamsarmax bulker of 82,000 DWT and promises fuel cost savings between 40-50%, letting ship owners meet tough future emissions targets using conventional fuels 13 June 2024 Kongsberg Maritime has unveiled its radical new 'Super-Efficient Bulker' vessel design concept. The new design is set to redefine industry standards, offering ship owners the means to meet stringent future compliance targets without abandoning conventional fuels. In response to the growing regulatory pressures on emissions and fuel efficiency, Kongsberg Maritime, together with Deltamarin, has developed a vessel design that demonstrates compliance with future regulations is achievable even when using conventional fuels. This new design promises fuel cost savings between 40-50% depending on the operational profile, addressing a crucial industry need. ""While low-carbon fuels are an option, many prefer to stick with conventional fuels. Our goal was to design a vessel capable of complying with predicted CII regulations throughout its lifetime, using advanced energy-saving technologies” Oskar Levander Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Kongsberg Maritime Oskar Levander, Vice President of Strategy and Business Development at Kongsberg Maritime, explains, “Ship owners face significant challenges in meeting tighter regulations. While low-carbon fuels are an option, many prefer to stick with conventional fuels. Our goal was to design a vessel capable of complying with predicted CII regulations throughout its lifetime, using advanced energy-saving technologies.” The vessel's system integrates a Hybrid Shaft Generator with frequency control, optimising electrical power usage and reducing emissions, while supporting increased loads from wind-assist technologies and air lubrication compressors, enhancing overall efficiency. For this innovative study, Kongsberg Maritime selected a Kamsarmax bulker of 82,000 DWT, a common vessel size globally, as the basis for the new design. The Kamsarmax represents a versatile choice as this vessel type often faces restrictions with the global availability of low-carbon fuels, making it an ideal candidate for the study. Collaborating with ship designers Deltamarin, Kongsberg Maritime explored various technologies to enhance the efficiency of the Kamsarmax. The result is the 'Super-Efficient Bulker', which incorporates several groundbreaking features. The new vessel concept is based on a unique combination of three tiltable rotor sails and two suction wing sails. This dual approach maximises wind power utilisation, adapting to varying wind conditions to ensure optimal performance. Henrik Sjöblom, from Kongsberg Maritime’s Concepts and Advisory team notes, “This hybrid wind technology approach offers the best of both worlds, making the vessel more versatile and efficient.” The hull form uses trapped air bubbles underneath and an air lubrication system to drastically reduce hydrodynamic resistance - a patent application is pending. Kongsberg Maritime has devised an innovative hull form that will trap bubbles, from an air lubrication system, to maximise the effects of resistance reduction and a patent application has been made to implement this concept. By trapping air bubbles beneath the hull, the system significantly reduces frictional resistance. The inclined hull, with a 1-degree slope from bow to stern, and vertically turned bilge keels create 'walls' to keep bubbles in place, enhancing fuel savings. Emphasising the benefits of slow steaming, the vessel operates at a reduced speed, balancing fuel efficiency with operational viability. A 1-knot speed reduction contributes to substantial savings in fuel, emissions, and maintenance costs. The vessel integrates a Hybrid Shaft Generator with frequency control, optimising electrical power usage and reducing emissions. This system supports the increased electric load from wind propulsion devices and air lubrication compressors, enhancing overall efficiency. Equipped with an Intelligent Energy Management System (iEMS) and route optimisation software, the vessel ensures optimal energy use, further enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing operational costs. To maintain the hull's cleanliness and further minimise resistance, the vessel is also fitted with a Hull Skater, which also contributes to maintaining low fuel consumption during operation. ""With a short payback period of five years, this vessel represents a smart investment for ship owners looking to reduce costs and meet future compliance targets"" Oskar Levander Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Kongsberg Maritime The 'Super-Efficient Bulker' is a novel design and advanced operation will, according to Kongsberg Maritime’s analysis, reduce fuel costs by more than half compared to a state-of-the-art vessel equipped with only conventional technology. Thus, offering an attractive solution for ship owners. The concept uniquely combines two different wind assist technologies, three tiltable rotor sails and two suction wing sails, which maximises wind power by adapting to varying wind conditions for optimal performance. Oskar Levander concludes, “This project has been a real eye-opener. The combination of advanced technologies creates significant savings, making our new design a game-changer. With a short payback period of five years, this vessel represents a smart investment for ship owners looking to reduce costs and meet future compliance targets. At Kongsberg, we are committed to integrating the best technologies to drive the maritime industry towards a cleaner, more efficient future.” For more information, please contact: Craig Taylor Senior Manager PR & Communications (+44) 774 9584 285",,,13 June 2024,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/news-and-events/news-archive/2024/super-efficient-bulker-vessel-design-concept-unveiled/
